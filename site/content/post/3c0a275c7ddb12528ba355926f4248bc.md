Evidence SARS-CoV-2 Emerged From a Biological Laboratory in Wuhan, China  
  
Published April 16, 2020. Updated May 2, 2020.  
  
1 Abstract  
The goal of this document is to examine evidence that may prove that (1) the SARS-CoV-2 virus was present at a biolaboratory in Wuhan, China, and (2) the SARS-CoV-2 virus was introduced into the greater Wuhan population by an infected lab worker or animal. These claims from this point on will be referred to as Claim 1 and Claim 2.  
  
This document does not attempt to provide a concrete conclusion on whether either claim is factually true. Rather, it examines the probability that each claim is true to allow the reader to make his or her own conclusions. While either claim cannot be irrevocably proven true, an attempt has been made to ensure the evidence used to support these claims is as factual as possible.  
  
If you would like to see a summarized version of every claim ("TL;DR") in this document, please see the [Conclusion]( "https://project-evidence.github.io/#%28part._the-end%29").  
  
Furthermore, this document does not attempt to investigate claims that SARS-CoV-2 is a "man-made bioweapon" or whether its release was intentional. See [A Note on Biowarfare]( "https://project-evidence.github.io/#%28part._biowarfare%29") and ["HIV Inserts"]( "https://project-evidence.github.io/#%28part._hiv-inserts%29").
