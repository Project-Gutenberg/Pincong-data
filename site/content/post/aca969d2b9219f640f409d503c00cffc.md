'It's reminiscent of Occupy': Protesters in Seattle have established a communal 'autonomous zone' to prove they don't need police

Protests have continued in many parts of the city including inside City Hall and around the Seattle Police Departments East Precinct, an area that has earned the moniker "Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone," during ongoing Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of George Floyds death.

Protesters in Seattle, Washington, took over part of the city on Monday, dubbing it an "autonomous zone."  
The area, which is still taking shape, has become a space for community organizing, art-making, and other community-building efforts.  
"It has symbolic meaning that once the police withdraw, it's not that communities descend into chaos, but that we can create safe, democratic, autonomous spaces," one occupant told Insider.

On Monday evening, police officers in Seattle boarded up the city's East Precinct and decamped, abandoning it after repeatedly clashing with protesters.  
  
In their wake, protesters have erected an "autonomous zone," with tents, free food, art-making, and rallies. Films are being screened on a projector in the evenings.  
  
The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, or CHAZ, as it's being called, emerged spontaneously. Encompassing the precinct and portions of the Capitol Hill neighborhood around it, the area was previously a flashpoint for protester-police skirmishes.  
  
Now, protesters are using the space to organize and build an alternative community. The occupants seek to prove that the community can operate without a police department at all.  
  
Permanent autonomous zones, like Hong Kong, have historically been designed to have near-total legal and political autonomy. In Seattle, something different is shaping up: An intentional community that disavows the police, and that cares for all of its members. CHAZ occupants distribute food widely, including to homeless people, and instituted a garbage-collection program on Wednesday.  
  
"It's reminiscent of Occupy \[Wall Street\]," one protester, who identified himself as a teacher and member of the Black Rose Anarchist Federation, told Insider. "It's like the people who show up and are doing the work."  
  
"People are really excited about it," he added.  
  
Among demonstrators, "most people seem cautiously optimistic," one woman in the CHAZ told Insider. "I haven't seen any cops since they all left."  
  
The Seattle Police Department did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.  
  
FreeCapitol Hill, a collective linked to the CHAZ, wants to reshape the whole city  
As CHAZ emerged, some protesters have released a list of demands.  
  
"We do not request reform, we demand abolition," FreeCapitol Hill, an anonymous collective, wrote in a blog post Tuesday. "We demand that the Seattle Council and the Mayor defund and abolish the Seattle Police Department and the attached Criminal Justice Apparatus."  
  
The collective demanded "de-gentrification" of the city, increased hiring of Black healthcare workers, and an overhaul of the Washington state public school curriculum, with a greater focus on the history of Black and Native Americans in the United States.  
  
They also called for an end to police violence.  
  
"We demand that the use of armed force be banned entirely," the collective wrote. "No guns, no batons, no riot shields, no chemical weapons, especially against those exercising their First Amendment right as Americans to protest."

Last week, Mayor Jenny Durkan put a 30-day ban on the police department's use of tear gas against protesters. After the ban was passed, however, officers still used the chemical irritant against a crowd, video footage shows.  
  
Several Seattle Fire Department vehicles "stationed near the Precinct to ensure emerging medical needs and fires are addressed if necessary," Durkan said in a statement on Tuesday morning. "Keeping this area safe is critical, as there are approximately 500 residential homes in this block."  
  
The autonomous zone has remained peaceful, according to Capitol Hill Seattle Blog, as residents, and some local politicians, call for radical change.  
  
"What we are seeing now is an uprising. A rebellion of young people. Not just nationwide but globally," Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant told a crowd on Monday evening.  
  
The next night, Sawant, who identifies as a socialist, held a public meeting calling on the city to defund the police and ban chemical weapons like tear gas, which is outlawed in warfare.  
  
Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda has also supported the effort, calling for the city police department budget to be halved, local news outlet MyNorthwest reported.  
  
As the autonomous zone takes shape, residents look toward restructured community  
Because the area emerged organically and without any official leadership, the protesters are exploring ways forward.  
  
The first general meeting of CHAZ occupants will be held on Wednesday afternoon, the teacher and anarchist said, where people will discuss "the purpose of occupying" the space.  
  
But the CHAZ has already taken on meaning for occupants.  
  
"It has symbolic meaning that once the police withdraw, it's not that communities descend into chaos, but that we can create safe, democratic, autonomous spaces," he said. That's a "testament to the claims around abolition currently that maybe we don't need these violent police forces in our community."  
  
"Trying to protect and honor Black life," he added, is "a big part of what's going on here."

西雅图遍地打海洛因打到浑身都是烂疮瘫在街边的，市政府在吸毒，治安，修路上效率极慢。反而在收税上效率奇高，从酒店到Airbnb到uber全是市政府的额外税收。现在又展现市政府可笑的效率了，要有收税一半的积极性也不会现在还被占领街区交通不畅了。  
西雅图的情况具体可以参考这个纪录片 Seattle is Dying （https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpAi70WWBlw）

這種事情和美國境內那些自稱獨立的“私人國家”一樣，政府壓根不會去理會，除非它們妨礙到了政府執法或者私立邊境。  
這事在美國壓根沒啥消息，一個小組織的意淫而已，更準確地說，是對社會不滿的抒發。  
所以不要指望政府援引某些法律去鎮壓，人家沒功夫去管。  
  
不過話說回來，capital hill這地方犯罪率有些地高有些地低，廢除警察真是想多了，還真以為社會上引起犯罪的只有警察暴力麼。。。現代社會主義者還是這麼愚蠢，真是替他們捉雞額。

既然如此，他們的美國id駕照跟護照通通取消吧，因為它們宣稱那裡不是美國，記得走出來跟進去的時候要先花錢辦簽證。

西雅图一大特色，大麻节。洛杉矶是白左，西雅图是白左中的战斗机。  
  
只要去药店说我腿疼，逼疼，蛋疼，随时随地买大麻随时随地high…  
  
跪求美国同意他们独立，别给他们发签证，经济封锁，别他们出来了霍霍人了，否则美国人会认为所有大学生都跟他们一样。
