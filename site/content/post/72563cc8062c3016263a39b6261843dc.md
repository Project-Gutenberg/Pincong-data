一首老歌给黑暗中的独行者，原唱是Simon & Garfunkel。  
  
歌词为Paul Simon作于1963-64年之间。据Marc Eliot写的Paul Simon传记记载，Simon将自己关在洗手间里熄了灯，专心感受黑暗写就。  
  
很多很多年以后，我在油管上看到了Disturbed演绎的这个版本，震撼。少有因翻唱而如此感动，竟再也回不到原唱的感觉……  
  
歌词中两组星号\*\*\*\*\*\*是我标的。中间的内容恰似专为墙内的发声者写的。"Silence, like a cancer, grows."  
  
歌词：  
  
Hello, darkness, my old friend  
I've come to talk with you again  
Because a vision softly creeping  
Left its seeds while I was sleeping  
  
And the vision that was planted in my brain  
Still remains  
Within the sound of silence  
  
In restless dreams I walked alone  
Narrow streets of cobblestone  
'Neath the halo of a street lamp  
I turned my collar to the cold and damp  
  
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light  
That split the night  
And touched the sound of silence  
  
\*\*\*\*\*\*  
And in the naked light I saw  
Ten thousand people, maybe more  
People talking without speaking  
People hearing without listening  
  
People writing songs that voices never share  
And no one dare  
Disturb the sound of silence  
  
"Fools," said I, ""You do not know  
Silence, like a cancer, grows  
Hear my words that I might teach you  
Take my arms that I might reach you""  
  
But my words like silent raindrops fell  
And echoed in the wells of silence  
\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
And the people bowed and prayed  
To the neon god they made  
And the sign flashed out its warning  
In the words that it was forming  
  
And the sign said  
"The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls  
And tenement halls  
And whispered in the sound  
Of silence"
