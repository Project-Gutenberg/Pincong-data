Trump Admin Shuts Down Radio Station Run by Chinese Propaganda Outlet  
  
联邦通信委员会FCC要求这家由凤凰卫视运营、坐落在墨西哥的广播电台在48小时内停止广播，因为这家广播电台没有披露它受控于中国。  
  
[https://freebeacon.com/national-security/trump-admin-shuts-down-radio-station-run-by-chinese-propaganda-outlet-phoenix-tv/]( "https://freebeacon.com/national-security/trump-admin-shuts-down-radio-station-run-by-chinese-propaganda-outlet-phoenix-tv/")  
  
A radio station controlled by the Chinese Communist Party propaganda outlet Phoenix TV has been ordered by the Trump administration to cease its broadcasts within 48 hours.  
  
The Federal Communications Commission ruled on Monday that a Mexico-based radio station owned in part by Phoenix TV—one of the Communist regime’s leading propaganda organs—must end its broadcasts due to its failure to disclose its ties to China.  
  
Prior to the FCC’s ruling, the station was exploiting a loophole that allows content produced in the United States to be broadcast from foreign radio towers, such as those in Mexico. Phoenix TV, which is headquartered in California, produced its content domestically and then used the more powerful Mexican station to broadcast across the U.S. border.  
  
The FCC denied a license for that radio station, XEWW-AM, because it "failed to include in their application a key participant, Phoenix Radio, which produces the Mandarin programming in its studio," the agency disclosed. Phoenix Radio, Phoenix TV's radio affiliate, was using the station to broadcast Chinese propaganda across Southern California, in violation of FCC statutes.  
  
Phoenix TV first found itself in Congress’s crosshairs earlier this year, after one of its reporters confronted President Donald Trump during a White House briefing about the coronavirus pandemic and Chinese government efforts to cover up the illness. The station’s presence at the White House generated concerns about the proliferation of Chinese state-controlled press organs in the United States.  
  
The Mexican radio station failed to disclose Phoenix TV's "extensive role" in producing content, an FCC spokesperson told the _Washington Free Beacon_. "It was a violation of the Communications Act for that company, which has ties to the Chinese government, not to be included on the application filed with the Commission. Therefore, the application was deficient and was dismissed."  
  
Phoenix TV used Mexican radio towers to skirt U.S. laws barring the dissemination of foreign propaganda in America. The FCC’s [ruling]( "https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-20-649A1.pdf") is a sign the Trump administration seeks to more aggressively police these types of outlets, which for years have operated with little oversight. Congress has moved in recent months to crack down on a range of Chinese broadcasters and social media accounts that help the Communist regime saturate the American marketplace with state-approved propaganda.  
  
The [_Free Beacon_ first reported]( "https://freebeacon.com/national-security/cruz-seeks-to-shut-down-chinese-propaganda-station-phoenix-tv/") in April that Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) was leading a charge to see the Mexican station shut down over its ties to Phoenix TV. Cruz introduced legislation exposing how Phoenix TV used a series of corporate cutouts to purchase the Mexican radio station and use its airwaves to broadcast Communist propaganda in the United States. The legislation would have closed loopholes in the FCC’s statutes that permitted Phoenix TV to operate in this manner.  
  
  
"Today’s decision sends an important message to the world that the U.S. will not allow China to exploit FCC loopholes and spread its propaganda over our airwaves," Cruz told the _Free Beacon_. "More importantly, this decision is a critical step in countering the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts to control what Americans see, hear, and ultimately think."  
  
The FCC ruling accuses XEWW-AM’s owners of trying to hide the station's ties to Phoenix TV. The station’s license application, the FCC said, did not disclose Phoenix TV’s role in producing the station’s broadcasts. The license was rejected on this basis. While the station can resubmit its application at a later date, it is likely to be rejected due to mounting concerns about Phoenix TV’s distribution of Communist regime propaganda.  
  
Cruz first raised concerns with the FCC in 2018, when the H&H Capital investment group purchased the Mexican station. H&H, Cruz said, is completely enmeshed in Phoenix TV’s operations. H&H is owned in large part by Vivian Huo, a U.S. citizen and Beijing native who formerly worked for several Chinese-run media outlets.

都不知道說什麼好了，川普老頭其實對貿易相關的中國事件比較心軟，媒體一向最緊繃。  
  
我想，可能中國的記者認為在美國問尖銳的問題是執行美國價值觀裡的“言論自由”，可是這打個比喻，和參加了一場大學派對就以為自己是最受歡迎的人一樣，陶醉過頭了忘了自己本質是什麼，美國容不容忍這類人。  
  
既然想問那就問吧，只是問完可能就整個公司被拉下去陪葬了……

微信關掉才是最好。  
海外華人，不會本地語，唯一的消息來源就是微信。假消息領到他們完全脫離生活，本地的實用資訊全無，一面倒的輿論遲早害了他們。
