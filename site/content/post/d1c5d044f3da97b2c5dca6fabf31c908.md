https://www.npr.org/2020/10/28/928816691/ex-homeland-security-official-outs-himself-as-anonymous-anti-trump-author  
  
真实身份为前国土安全部dhs的cheif of staff，叫miles taylor。  
  
他的身份也并不是什么能接触到什么机密信息的川普内阁高官，就是一个部的幕僚长（可能像办公厅主任之类的职位），这种职务见到总统都不太可能，要爆料也就爆国土安全部的料了。。。。  
  
他之前自称的身份是川普政府内的高级官员，是一个“抵抗分子”，为了美国大公无私的抵抗川普的“胡搞”：https://youtu.be/BhvhZH-zvqE   
  
npr文章里面提到了他的事迹：  
Throughout his post, Taylor was explicit about his commitment to the Republican Party and asserted he "wanted this President to succeed" when he joined the administration alongside John Kelly, Trump's first Homeland Security secretary who later became the White House chief of staff. 反串的常用话术：我希望xx成功 但是。。。  
  
But Taylor went on to say, "Too often in times of crisis, I saw Donald Trump prove he is a man without character, and his personal defects have resulted in leadership failures so significant that they can be measured in lost American lives. I witnessed Trump's inability to do his job over the course of two-and-a-half years.瞎编一  
  
He said the president's flaws were evident to "everyone" but that most were "were hesitant to speak up for fear of reprisals." 瞎编二  
  
Taylor has appeared in ads for Republican Voters Against Trump, a group that is supporting Joe Biden in the presidential contest. He also [wrote an op-ed]( "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/at-homeland-security-i-saw-firsthand-how-dangerous-trump-is-for-america/2020/08/17/f10bb92e-e0a3-11ea-b69b-64f7b0477ed4_story.html") in _The Washington Post_ in August detailing what he said were actions by the president that made the country "less secure."真实身份为川黑  
  
But it was his [anonymous op-ed]( "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html") in _The New York Times _in September 2018 in which he declared he was "part of the resistance inside the Trump administration" that delighted the president's critics and added to fears within the administration of a "deep state" that was acting against Trump's orders.瞎编三  
  
  
  
  
所以 左媒真的有可能就编了四年川普的假新闻

就算有这么多左媒作恶的证据，你葱左壬还是会通过胡搅蛮缠和复读机式发言来拒绝事实~  
比如某个维尼头的
