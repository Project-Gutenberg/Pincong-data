Powerful: Protesters Spell Out 'Love' With Burning Homes And Businesses  
June 1st, 2020

MINNEAPOLIS, MN—In a powerful display of their care for love and justice, protesters in Minneapolis burned the word "LOVE" into the city, arranging the inspiring message with homes and businesses set ablaze by their riots.  
  
  
Heartfelt and moving.  
  
"We just really wanted to show how much we care about love and social justice by burning this community into a powerful reminder of what it's all about," said local protester Jake Hernandez, who had flown in from Portland for the event. "Now, when police and fire helicopters fly over to try to restore order, they'll be inspired by our message of love and harmony."  
  
Upon seeing the heart-wrenching message of unity, police dropped their batons, ripped off their badges, donned bandanas, picked up bricks, and joined the protesters in their rioting and looting. "I don't know how I didn't see the light before," said former police officer, now Antifa chapter leader Bridget Morrison as she lobbed a Molotov cocktail into a minority-owned business. "I'm woke to the cause of love and harmony."  
  
What a powerful message! The protesters were also planning to burn the word "SOCIAL JUSTICE" into predominantly black parts of town but have sadly run out of buildings to burn.

 Antifa時常暴恐，我也還記得，可是不甚清楚。我翻開照片一看，這照片沒有年代，歪歪斜斜的每张照片上都有Antifa烧出了「Love」这个单词。

着火时会停电，停电了就没法ps了，所以这是真的。

美国黑人和白左想要什么？  
太简单了，想要不劳而获。  
只是可惜了，这么好的时间点对付中共，除了这种事。  
为什么每一次美国抽出手来对付中共总得发生点什么。
