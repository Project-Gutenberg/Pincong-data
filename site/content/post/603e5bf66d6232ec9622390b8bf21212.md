Seattle police clear CHOP zone

Following "ongoing violence and public safety issues," Seattle's mayor has issued an executive order to clear the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP) zone -- a several block, autonomous police-free zone -- and Seattle police enforced the order Wednesday morning.  
  
Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best said in a statement, "This order, and our police response, comes after weeks of violence in and around the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest zone, including four shootings, resulting in multiple injuries and the deaths of two teenagers."  
  
"I support peaceful demonstrations," Best said, adding, "the CHOP has become lawless and brutal. Four shootings -- two fatal -- robberies, assaults, violence and countless property crimes have occurred in this several block area."  
  
Police began issuing dispersal orders early Wednesday, and as of 9:25 a.m. local time, officers made 31 arrests for assault, failure to disperse, obstruction and unlawful weapon possession, the department said.  
  
The CHOP zone was formed after explosive standoffs between protesters and Seattle police after the death of George Floyd, a Black man in Minnesota who died while in police custody. Following days of clashes, Seattle police on June 8 largely withdrew from the Capitol Hill district, leaving a void for protesters.  
  
The protesters seized a roughly six-block area, including the east precinct, to create an "autonomous police-free zone."  
  
The zone remained for weeks, and Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan told ABC News' "Nightline" last month that it required time and distance to de-escalate the tensions between the people and police.  
  
"We need to have some time for people to feel that they have had the ability to protest and raise their voices and have the time to work, not just with the people on Capitol Hill but with all of Seattle," she said.  
  
"These protests are protests fundamentally about a policing system that has tried to dominate Black Americans through the history of our country. You don't meet those protests with domination. You meet them with listening and with change," Durkan said.

属实正常，  
6月初到7月一个月间，如果把这个地方算”国家或地区“  
恐怕CHOP/CHAZ是针对黑人犯罪率最高以及黑人死于犯罪人口比率最高的地区了。  
  
前两天那个14岁及16岁黑人少年在CHAZ/CHOP内被袭击（似乎还是CHAZ/CHOP的安全保障人员做的）  
更远点，20号CHAZ/CHOP不明原因枪击死亡的黑人rap歌手  
CHAZ/CHOP还能有凝聚力才是怪事...  
在推上查关键词，一点点同情CHAZ/CHOP的推文都难以见到。

西雅圖市長Jenny Durkan肯定要下台了，她的twitter上基本都是讓她resign的。她之前進去視察國，說CHOP是summer of love，還罵川普打壓抗議。然而可笑的是，CHOP在成立不到一個月的時間裡已經發生多起暴力事件甚至是命案了。

有趣的是在BLM「拜訪」了市長的家宅之後，不足兩天之內她便派警隊驅散CHOP了。  
真是標準的左膠。
