https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/10/21/bombshell-statement-biden-insider-claims-he-was-recipient-of-the-email-says-he-witnessed-joe-hunter-discussing-deals/  
  
文章摘录：  
  
**A whistleblower CEO and Biden insider,** Tony Bobulinski, released a public statement on Wednesday evening backing up the reporting of the _New York Post_ from last week and claiming that he personally witnessed Democrat presidential nominee former Vice President Joe Biden discussing business deals with his son, Hunter Biden.吹哨人为拜登阵营内部人士  
  
  
Screenshots published by the _New York Post_ indicate that Bobulinski was one of the recipients of the email in question. The email was authored by James Gilliar of the consulting firm J2cR. Now that **Bobulinski is publicly confirming the authenticity of this email, which, again, he was the recipient of,** that furthers the story significantly, and Joe Biden’s presidential campaign does not deny their authenticity. 吹哨人同时承认爆料邮件为真 吹哨人本人也是邮件收信人之一  
  
  
Bobulinski’s statement would be the first on-record confirmation of this from a source in the Biden universe. Bobulinski said:  
  

> What I am outlining is fact. I know it is fact because I lived it. I am the CEO of Sinohawk Holdings which was a partnership between the Chinese operating through CEFC/Chairman Ye and the Biden family. I was brought into the company to be the CEO by James Gilliar and Hunter Biden. **The reference to ‘the Big Guy’ in the much publicized May 13, 2017 email is in fact a reference to Joe Biden**. The other ‘JB’ referenced in that email is Jim Biden, Joe’s brother.  

  
吹哨人承认big guy为joe biden  
  
  
_Hunter Biden called his dad ‘the Big Guy’ or ‘my Chairman,’ and_ _**frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing.**_ 吹哨人公开信中提到拜登曾经多次给亨特提供生意上的建议  
  
  
  
**Sources familiar with the matter told Breitbart News that Bobulinski is the person whose allegations and inside information are the centerpiece of a forthcoming investigation by the _Wall Street Journal_**. That _Wall Street Journal_ story has not published yet, several days after the newspaper staff indicated to some the piece would come out—it is unclear why the _Journal_ has not yet published—but President Donald Trump hinted on a conference call earlier this week that such a story was coming from the newspaper. 文章提到wsj也将发布一份调查

吹哨人完整声明如下：  
  
  

> _My name is Tony Bobulinski. The facts set forth below are true and accurate; they are not any form of domestic or foreign disinformation.  Any suggestion to the contrary is false and offensive. I am the recipient of the email published seven days ago by the New York Post which showed a copy to Hunter Biden and Rob Walker. That email is genuine. _  
>   
> _This afternoon I received a request from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs and the Senate Committee on Finance requesting all documents relating to my business affairs with the Biden family as well as various foreign entities and individuals. I have extensive relevant records and communications and I intend to produce those items to both Committees in the immediate future. _  
>   
> _I am the grandson of a 37 year Army Intelligence officer, the son of a 20+ year career Naval Officer and the brother of a 28 year career Naval Flight Officer.  I myself served our country for 4 years and left the Navy as LT Bobulinski.  I held a high level security clearance and was an instructor and then CTO for Naval Nuclear Power Training Command.  I take great pride in the time my family and I served this country.  I am also not a political person. What few campaign contributions I have made in my life were to Democrats. _  
>   
> _If the media and big tech companies had done their jobs over the past several weeks I would be irrelevant in this story.  Given my long standing service and devotion to this great country, I could no longer allow my family’s name to be associated or tied to Russian disinformation or implied lies and false narratives dominating the media right now._  
>   
> _After leaving the military I became an institutional investor investing extensively around the world and on every continent. I have traveled to over 50 countries.  I believe, hands down, we live in the greatest country in the world._  
>   
> _What I am outlining is fact.  I know it is fact because I lived it.  I am the CEO of Sinohawk Holdings which was a partnership between the Chinese operating through CEFC/Chairman Ye and the Biden family.  I was brought into the company to be the CEO by James Gilliar and Hunter Biden.  The reference to “the Big Guy” in the much publicized May 13, 2017 email is in fact a reference to Joe Biden.  The other “JB” referenced in that email is Jim Biden, Joe’s brother._  
>   
> _Hunter Biden called his dad ‘the Big Guy’ or ‘my Chairman,’ and frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing. I’ve seen Vice President Biden saying he never talked to Hunter about his business. I’ve seen firsthand that that’s not true, because it wasn’t just Hunter’s business, they said they were putting the Biden family name and its legacy on the line._  
>   
> _I realized the Chinese were not really focused on a healthy financial ROI.  They were looking at this as a political or influence investment. Once I realized that Hunter wanted to use the company as his personal piggy bank by just taking money out of it as soon as it came from the Chinese, I took steps to prevent that from happening._  
>   
> _The Johnson Report connected some dots in a way that shocked me — it made me realize the Bidens had gone behind my back and gotten paid millions of dollars by the Chinese, even though they told me they hadn’t and wouldn’t do that to their partners._  
>   
> _I would ask the Biden family to address the American people and outline the facts so I can go back to being irrelevant — and so I am not put in a position to have to answer those questions for them. _  
>   
> _I don’t have a political ax to grind; I just saw behind the Biden curtain and I grew concerned with what I saw. The Biden family aggressively leveraged the Biden family name to make millions of dollars from foreign entities even though some were from communist controlled China._  
>   
> _God Bless America!!!!_

我说的是整个民主党。  
  
但不幸的是，这会给那些「还从来没上过台」的革命左一些空子。

声明中有一段话很重要，那就是中国的投资不是正常的商业投资，而就是为了买拜登的政治影响力。  
  
声明人的身份也很过硬，出身情报和海军世家，本人曾任海军核训练项目首席技术官。

下面是2012年亨特与福克斯新闻某评论员之间的邮件往来，似乎显示拜登与该主持人勾结，以宣布拜登是副总统候选人辩论的胜利者（尽管该主持人与莱恩表面友好，后者是当时共和党的副总统候选人）
