Chinese diplomatic gatecrash incident alleged at Taiwan event in Suva  
By PMC Editor - October 19, 202002836  
   
  
  
Reports are emerging of a serious diplomatic incident in Suva 10 days ago in which two Chinese diplomats from the Suva embassy assaulted a member of the Taiwanese delegation in Fiji.  
  
The incident allegedly took place on the evening of Thursday, October 8, on the fringes of a reception at the Grand Pacific Hotel hosted by the Taipei Trade Office to celebrate Taiwan’s National Day.  
  
There was no mention of the incident in the publicity about the event released by the Taiwanese, that included a speech by Taiwan’s representative in Fiji, Jessica Lee, emphasising cooperation in such fields as agriculture and medicine and praising Fiji’s climate leadership.  
  
Yet the event was evidently marred by an astonishing physical altercation between mainland diplomats and a Taiwanese official.  
  
Grubsheet understands that two members of the Chinese Embassy gatecrashed the function and began taking photographs of the proceedings and of those attending the function, which according to the Taiwanese included members of the diplomatic corps, international organisations, NGOs and Fiji’s Chinese community.  
  
According to well placed sources, they were asked to leave by a male member of the Taiwanese delegation but refused to do so.  
  
Later the two Chinese embassy officials allegedly assaulted the delegation member, “beating him up so badly ” – according to these accounts – that he required hospital treatment in Suva. The reports say police were called to the GPH but refused to take the matter further when the Chinese officials claimed diplomatic immunity.  
  
Incident ‘hushed up’  
  
The entire incident is said to have been “hushed up” but there is still a diplomatic standoff because Taiwan has lodged an official protest with the Fijian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  
  
No other details are available for the moment. But it is clearly unacceptable for Chinese diplomats to assault other foreign representatives on Fijian soil.  
  
The two may be claiming diplomatic immunity but it does not give them the freedom to break Fijian law in such a flagrant and outrageous manner.  
  
It is open to Fiji to declare the two Chinese diplomats persona non grata – the diplomatic term for an unacceptable or unwelcome individual – and require their removal from the country. But this is going to be a big test for the FijiFirst government’s resolve because of its close ties with Beijing and it is not a good sign that 10 days have passed so far without public comment.  
  
  
Only six days before the GPH incident, on October 2, the Chinese ambassador in Suva, Qian Bo, hosted Fiji’s “big three” – President Jioji Konrote, Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama and the Speaker of the Parliament, Ratu Epeli Nailatikau – at a function at the Chinese residence to celebrate the founding of the People’s Republic.  
  
Relations between the Fijian government and Beijing are extremely close. Last year, Fiji bowed to pressure from China to force Taiwan to rename its office in Suva from the “Trade Mission of the Republic of China” to the “Taipei Trade Office”.  
  
Taiwan protested against the decision to no avail.  
  
The GPH incident is evidently part of a global pattern of aggressive behaviour by the mainland to assert its claim to Taiwan, which includes President Xi Jinping threatening to invade the island by the end of the decade.  
  
Fiji is not the only country in which Chinese diplomats have been behaving badly.  
  
Yet however small we are and whatever the level of Chinese aid, we cannot and must not tolerate unlawful behaviour on Fijian soil and the two offenders should be declared persona non grata as soon as possible and be and be withdrawn from Fiji.  
  
In her speech at the October 8 function, Jessica Lee alluded to Chinese aggression not just towards Taiwan but towards pro-democracy supporters in Hong Kong.  
  
“2020 is a year of unimaginable challenges, but it is also a year showing Taiwan people’s fortitude and resilience in pursuing democracy, freedom and prosperity. We have completed the 15th presidential election and joined other members of the international community to uphold the rights and interests of the people of Hong Kong,” she said.

在大国那里撒泼打滚，在小国那里就寻衅滋事，这种做法跟街头的小地痞有啥区别——在厉害的人那里撒泼打滚，在软弱的人面前寻衅滋事

看到這則新聞感到難過  
不知為何這難過並不是全為受傷的台灣人,因為我知道她會沒事的  
這難過大部分是悲憫我們的對手的智商,連動物都有理性,這人動物不如啊  
長這麼大了還只會像熊孩子撒野,真想看他爸媽長怎樣

相信中國不會進攻臺灣，不是因為他們文明，中國野蠻這一點，全世界都清楚。  
是因為他們不敢。  
  
二戰後至今為止，還沒有一個被國際公認的民主政權遭到進攻時，西方國家不予干涉的先例。  
烏克蘭那種與西方沒有直接利益的國家，被俄羅斯拿下克里米亞後，俄羅斯隨即被整個西方世界制裁，哪怕俄羅斯假惺惺的弄了一個公投，也沒有改變這一點。  
  
中國的俄國父親只是拿下烏克蘭的一個彈丸之地都這樣了，你以為中國進攻臺灣不會付出更多嗎？而且與烏克蘭不同，臺灣的戰力和利益可不是烏克蘭能比的。  
  
進攻臺灣這個代價中國付不出來，所以相信中國「不敢」進攻臺灣。

中國真的是把超限戰發揮到極致  
  
看中國外交人員如何利用外交豁免權在他國土地上合法打人  
  
偉哉
