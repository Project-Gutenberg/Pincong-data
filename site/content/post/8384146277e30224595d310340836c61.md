这戏剧性堪比伊拉克核查了  
  
[Covid: Wuhan scientist would 'welcome' visit probing lab leak theory - BBC News]( "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-55364445")  
  
**A Chinese scientist at the centre of unsubstantiated claims that the coronavirus leaked from her laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan has told the BBC she is open to "any kind of visit" to rule it out.**  
  
The surprise statement from Prof Shi Zhengli comes as a World Health Organization team prepares to travel to Wuhan next month to begin its investigation into the origins of Covid-19.  
  
The remote district of Tongguan, in China's south-western province of Yunnan, is hard to reach at the best of times. But when a BBC team tried to visit recently, it was impossible.  
  
Plain-clothes police officers and other officials in unmarked cars followed us for miles along the narrow, bumpy roads, stopping when we did, backtracking with us when we were forced to turn around.

> Prof Shi won international acclaim for her discovery that the illness known as Sars, which killed more than 700 people in 2003, was caused by a virus that probably came from a species of bat in a Yunnan cave.  
>   
> Ever since, Prof Shi - often referred to as "China's Batwoman" - has been in the vanguard of a project to try to predict and prevent further such outbreaks.  
>   
> By trapping bats, taking faecal samples from them, and then carrying those samples back to the lab in Wuhan, 1,600km (1,000 miles) away, the team behind the project has identified hundreds of new bat coronaviruses.  
>   
> But the fact that Wuhan is now home to the world's leading coronavirus research facility, as well as the first city to be ravaged by a pandemic outbreak of a deadly new one, has fuelled suspicion that the two things are connected.  

  
  
这是新闻记者如何巧妙表达观点的范例  
  

> To a follow-up question about whether that would include a formal investigation with access to the WIV's experimental data and laboratory records, Prof Shi said: "I would personally welcome any form of visit based on an open, transparent, trusting, reliable and reasonable dialogue. But the specific plan is not decided by me."  
>   
> The BBC subsequently received a call from the WIV's press office, saying that Prof Shi was speaking in a personal capacity and her answers had not been approved by the WIV.

  
  
石正丽对西方记者说来不来这由不得我烦了党国大忌。 五毒所的领导似乎不喜欢石女士的态度随后通过新闻部门改口

BBC怎么不听话啊？武汉这边的制片、导演、编剧、演员、摄像、配音、后期、宣发各单位都准备就绪了，真是急死个人。

BBC不按我匪规定的路线采访是间谍罪，要主动向CCAV自首，上电视认罪。否则，我匪科学论证英国也是武肺病毒的源头。
