_Editors note: This letter remains in the condition in which it was sent._  
  
Recently, Jon Zubieta, a professor at Syracuse University was placed on administrative leave from teaching because he used the words "Wuhan Flu" and "Chinese Communist Party Virus" in his syllabus. I am a Chinese graduate student of UB, but I totally cannot agree with the arbitrary decision made by Syracuse University. Even I do not think the professor did anything wrong. This is a question worth discussing, because Syracuse University is next to us, now UB opens again, many professors and students will talk about COVID-19 when socializing, so we should have a clear understanding of this matter.  
  
As a native Chinese, I do not feel offended when I heard these words. First of all, in fact, many Chinese people use the words "Wuhan Flu" and "Chinese Communist Party Virus". In my experience, in Hong Kong and Taiwan, people use these two words frequently. In January 2020, when the pandemic just broke out in Wuhan, people in mainland China were also using the word "Wuhan Flu". However, with the spread of the epidemic, China banned the use of these two words.  
  
Second, the reason why the Chinese Communist Party forbids people to use these two words is because it wants to cover up the shortcomings of its system. At the beginning of the outbreak of the pandemic, several doctors in Wuhan posted information about the pandemic on social media urging people to pay attention, but they were immediately arrested by police. If people had paid attention to the opinions of these doctors at that time, the situation in Wuhan would have been much better than later. This is exactly the problem of the dictatorship of the Chinese Communist Party. The two words "Wuhan Flu" and "Chinese Communist Party Virus" easily remind people of the shortcomings of the Communist Party system, and that is the reason that the Chinese Communist Party forbids people to use these two words.  
  
At last, what the professor said has nothing to do with racial discrimination. I am not a racist. A few months ago, when the Graduate History Association issued a statement in support of the BLM movement, I signed my name on it. But the situation in China is different from that in the United States. For a long time, black Americans have been oppressed by the system. Although the system of racial segregation has been abolished, some words still represent racism and white supremacy, so these words are not allowed to be used. However, the words "Wuhan Flu" and "Chinese Communist Party Virus" do not represent racism, but expose the problems of the Communist Party System and promote people's reflection on the dictatorship system. On the contrary, the Chinese Communist Party forbids the use of these two words, which is a kind of oppressive autocratic hegemony. Therefore, it is unreasonable for Syracuse University to claim that the professor has damaged the academic environment of equality and inclusiveness on campus. In my opinion, freedom of speech is not only the fundamental right of citizens protected by the constitution of the United States, but also the basis of diversified campus environment. The rights of this professor should also be protected. The fear of offending the Chinese Communist Party or Chinese students and destroying freedom of speech on American campuses is an appeasement of the autocratic system, which is not a good lesson for the next generation of scholars. As someone commented on the Syracuse University's Facebook page “Stop the tail from wagging the dog”.  
  
All in all, I think the decision of Syracuse University is unreasonable. Syracuse University should withdraw the punishment for professors, and it is not wise for UB to make any restrictions on the expression of COVID-19.

雪城大學的校方和教授隊伍確實是特別親中共的。其親中共的程度比湖對岸的多大和鄰居的康奈爾嚴重多了。好教授Jon Zubieta還是轉去一所正常點的大學吧，如果可能的話。雪城這個又紅又專的地方，就算能留住，在共產黨的淫威下苟活也毫無尊嚴。

刚想下意识骂两句留学生小粉红傻逼。一看这个写信的留学生还是挺正常的啊。  
草，原来是学校站中共，留学生很清醒啊。剧本拿倒了啊。  
给这个敢说心里话，仗义执言的留学生点个赞吧。希望学校撤回决定。  
  
Ps:喝过洋墨水的留学生，是比瓦房店的土生大学生姿势水平和成材率高一些啊。文明的土壤更容易产生文明的种子，此言诚不欺我。

这中国留学生是替教授仗义直言，抗议校方受中共影响。批斗的对象不应该是这些大学嘛？  
这写信的中国留学生是脱支的

真的嗎？  
你難道不覺得只是現在風頭太盛，要是沒人出來講兩句公道話，搞不好就被趕回中國，所以不得不跳出來？

这可是公开信，我不觉得应该恶意揣测仗义执言的人。人家也是担了风险的。能用普世价值观表达观点就已经值得尊敬了，至少，咱们葱油也不能上去踩两脚

我知道，就是说那个学校不行，那留学生脱支了建议转学，不然天天被战狼粉蛆恶心死

转学就算了吧，太亏学分了。美国大学转学最多只承认40个学分。读到大二以后都是血亏。还不如直接申请庇护呢。

澳洲留学生路过。  
  
一般遇到这种问题，反贼甚至岁静都是沉默不语以表示自己对自由的支持。但上次UNSW支持香港事件后，喷UNSW不够厉害的，都是「反华（gòng）」  
  
我在某社交平台发了一句「如果世界上只有一种声音，那就是谎言。」就被喷死了。甚至  
「大部分收入来自于国际生，主要是中国留学生  
另外一边让国际生去给中国施压，说侵犯人权  
  
外媒一直在拿体制做文章  
难道民主了、（武汉肺炎）死遍，自己体制就优秀了」  
都被骂了。因为点出了问题所在。

好！很有精神！  
这个标题吸引我点进来了，不然我平常还真不关心中国留学生怎么想  
如果都能像这位留学生一样武德充沛，中国乃至世界范围内还有你共什么事
