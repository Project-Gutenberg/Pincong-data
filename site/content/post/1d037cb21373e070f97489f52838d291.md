One American coach who worked for the NBA in China described the project as "a sweat camp for athletes."  
  
  
The NBA brought in elite coaches and athletic trainers with experience in the G League and Division I basketball to work at the academies. One former coach described watching a Chinese coach fire a ball into a young player's face at point-blank range and then "kick him in the gut."  
  
  
  
  
  
In Xinjiang, players lived in cramped dormitories; the rooms were meant for two people, but a former coach said bunk beds were used to put as many as eight to 10 athletes in a room. Players trained two or three times a day and had few extracurricular activities. NBA coaches and officials became concerned that although education had been announced as a pillar of the academy program, the sports bureaus did not provide formal schooling. When the players -- some as young as 13 -- weren't training, eating or sleeping, they were often left unsupervised.  
  
  
  
One former league employee who worked in China wondered how the NBA, which has been so progressive on issues around Black Lives Matter and moved the 2017 All-Star Game out of Charlotte, North Carolina, over a law requiring transgender people to use bathrooms corresponding to the sex listed on their birth certificates, could operate a training camp amid a Chinese government crackdown that also targeted NBA employees.  
  
  
  
The NBA was able to work out an arrangement by which players at the academy in Zhejiang would be educated at a local international school. But similar efforts in Xinjiang and Shandong were unsuccessful.

曾經在體校10年。是一個“黑貓白貓”的環境，就是不管你怎麼做（吃藥打針作弊都可以），能夠拿金牌就是王道。  
  
所謂的運動員就是一大群身體素質比常人好的小孩子，拉去集中鍛煉，練蠱式的鍛鍊。學習科目不重要。只要能拿到金牌，隨便挑名校，如果拿不到金牌，但是可以達到國家一級運動員可以保送一線大學，國家二級可以保送二線大學，如果再送點錢還可以去一線。  
  
我練到高中，練市運動會都拿不到金牌，所以便放棄運動出國了。現在回頭來看當時的體校同學混得好的做體育老師，或者體校的體制裡混著。混得差一點的保安。混得最差的坐牢。 這個結果是絕對可以看到的，十年體校，文化課全都不及格，練到一身蠻力。有些女運動員興奮劑吃的長腿毛，腿毛比男的還粗，穿絲襪還從洞裡鑽出來。  
  
當然也有非常有出息的, 劉翔。 在一個體校鍛鍊，彼此見過但不認識，年齡差不多但是練習的項目不一樣。

ESPN是迪士尼的。米老鼠不是傻子。现在风向要变，尤其被彭佩奥点名训斥之后。  
  
木兰推迟档期就是一个信号，现在又来开涮NBA的小号。这种做法可攻可守。如果美国国内风向彻底转向灭共，那就木兰彻底撤档，这事继续做大。  
  
如果华尔街舔共依旧，那就把这个纪录片埋了，木兰接着推广。  
  
奸商本色。

我就問問允許“killcops”但禁止“free hong kong" 的NBA，還有“民主鬥士”詹姆斯，敢不敢說兩句？

对中国人是常识的东西，他们还需要花费几十几百万美金调查，可见两个世界鸿沟之大。

说明风向要变了，库班詹姆斯这些猪党的垃圾如果继续一边BLM一边对我党舔腚，恐怕要吃不了兜着走了
