中文全文如下：  

>   
> 我们之所以走到今天这么一个地步，可以讲两个大的问题上，从根上要刨起。一个就是我们这个体制，一个就是我们这个理论。那么从体制这个角度讲，朱学勤老师早就说过一句话：毛泽东用来搞文革的体制，邓小平拿来搞改革。改革开放以后，市场经济作为一种技术性的操作手段，我们拿过来用了，很快的就把经济搞上去了。  
>   
> 但是我们讲市场经济是两层，一层是要素市场，一层是商品市场。涉及到要素市场的这些改革至今没有真正的往前推进。所以你那个商品市场就不可能是一个真正商品市场经济，总是被别人操控价格，总是被别人垄断资源。因为你的那个要素市场不改革，那么为什么，它还是跟权力有关系。  
>   
> 所以我们这个体制这个问题没有解决。那么因此体制走到今天这一步，选上这么个人，或者说高层捏乎出这么个东西来，坐到大位置上去，那是说明什么，这个体制本身已经是没有出路了。改它没有用，改是没有用了。这个体制从根本上讲必须要抛弃掉它。所以我们讲的改革就不再是一个这个框架体制还要，然后我们再做。这是我第一条。有人会这么认为啊，我这么一说是不是这个体制抛弃掉它然后我们就要闹革命去吗？不是那么回事。这是第一点。  
>   
> 第二点就是我们这个理论从根本上出了问题。且不说当初中国共产党接受的那个马克思列宁主义对不对，这个话都先不说。实际上这个理论上的很多东西是要刨根的。就说我们那个4000人大会的时候，如果那个时候，就是说，邓小平不阻挡党内来反思文革，不仅从政治上否定而且从理论上根本抛弃那个，那么不至于到现在还在这儿为文革翻案。  
>   
> 因为政治这个东西是时过境迁，它是可以翻过来倒过去的。但是如果你在理论上把它的根刨掉，把它的思想基础彻底地，或者说是重重地摧垮了，那么它要想来翻回这个文革的东西它就非常难。因此我就觉得我们在改革开放以后这两个最根本的问题没解决，一个就是体制，一个就是理论。那么所以走到现在怎么办？我个人的看法，怎么说呢，如果要讲情况的话从修宪开始，我们就可以看到这个党事实上已经是一个政治僵尸。尸体的尸，[政治僵尸]( "https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/tag/%e6%94%bf%e6%b2%bb%e5%83%b5%e5%b0%b8/")。  
>   
> 明摆着那个修宪，从党内程序上它就是不合法的。他绑架了18届三中全会，他在三中全会前的两天，抢着抛出这个取消任期制的这个说法。迫使三中全会跟咽狗屎一样的咽下去。那么你三中全会那么多中央委员居然都没有一个人敢在三中全会上把这个问题提出来。  
>   
> 所以这个党本身已经是一个政治僵尸。而一个人，一个主要领导可以凭着他的这种掌握了刀把子、枪杆子，然后又捏住了体制本身，就是党内一个就是官员本身的贪腐，第二就是党内没有任何人权和法治保障党员干部的权利。这两条被捏在手里面，所以这个9000万党员成了奴隶和个人使用的工具。他需要的时候说党怎么走，不需要的时候，你这个党员干部就不是党员干部了，就是他想把你弄到哪里去你就成为了贪腐分子。  
>   
> 你就看看吧，我们现在什么状况：党内的那些个领导干部被这个国家监察委员会最近处理的人，我不是说这些处理的人本身有没有问题，我觉得没有问题也会弄出点问题来。更何况这个体制本身已经使得很多人不干净了。但问题是你定的那些个罪名，也得到国家法律上查查，也得到党纪上去看看，那些属于违纪，你只能用违纪去处置他。那些属于国家法律定了的，就说刑法上有这罪名的你可以捏他，我们现在什么不支持实体经济就成了罪名，然后这个妄议中央就成了个罪名，对党不老实这也叫罪名，哪里还有一点法治的味道，哪里还有一点政党的感觉。完全成了一个黑帮老大。想怎么处置手底下的奴才，他就怎么处置。所以我说这个党已经是个政治僵尸了。  
>   
> 目前这个状况，谁想出来挽救这个危局都不可能，何况他还一条道要走到黑，谁说话都不行。其实我想过这个问题，最开始他上来的时候是明里暗里的想弄点个人崇拜，提高自己的威信。提不上来啊。\[马\]晓力姐，你可能还记得吧，就是16年的五月份，人大会堂的那个演出，你带头去抵制了，结果那个事情闹得很大。那场演出就此就罢休了。  
>   
> 接着你看吧，16年的11月份出了什么呢？把妄议中央放进了十八届六中全会的党纪里面。然后四个意识，什么看齐意识之类的东西，放到了这个政治正确的必须要说的官话，就说现在标配语，我们叫做标准配置。什么四个自信，四个意识，两个维护。尤其这个两个维护，全党围着一个人转，这还叫政党吗？早就不是政党了。他就是一个黑帮老大，手里捏着的一个工具而已。  
>   
> 所以这个党成了政治僵尸。你现在谁能出来，谁能改变它都不可能。如果说有可能，[换人]( "https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/tag/%e6%8d%a2%e4%ba%ba/")，这是第一步。我觉得当然最好的是换人。这当务之急，我觉得换人这是第一条。但是你可以看到他现在在干什么，他现在手里捏着刀把子，他把军队全捏在手里，他把政法委，警察全捏在手里，他把所有人都可以用高科技去监视。谁能够来、出来说我们来解决问题，不可能。你就开个中央常委会，政治局常委会的那个，我们讲少数服从多数嘛，有吗？没有。  
>   
> 所以我觉得现在这个状况，如果有当然好，我先说如果有常委会最后所来个集体决议，少数服从多数，你这个干得不行，不能把一个国家一个党应为个人重大问题而拖到死胡同里面去，让9000万党员14亿人民给你陪葬，这是不可以的。那么如果说我们的中央政治局常委的这些人对党但凡还有点责任心，对这个国家，对民族还有点责任心我觉得这个七个常委是应该开会做决议的，换人吧。其实只要你换了人，外部的环境就开始松了，因为这就是个标志，告诉外面我们要转向了。只要这个人在台上，外部的环境只有越来越紧张，是不可能缓的，是不可能与我们缓和的。而你换了人，外部环境就可以缓和，因为你做了个不说话别人都知道你有可能转向。这是我觉得最好的事。  
>   
> 那么其他的这些常委，有那个对党对人民的责任心吗？没有。现在这帮人连政客都算不上。我觉得他们就完全就是一个人的手下的奴才上来的。那么当然我这么一说的话，可能会把什么汪洋啊之类的都打到里边，李克强。是吧。其实他们也是很不容易，在各自的位置上很努力的在，就是，来减少损失，努力的在做些工作，缓和危局。这个我们其实都看到了。那么这个党我觉得老人也好，现在的这个党的常委也好，能不能再有一次为了这个国家，为了人民奋起，做一个少数服从多数的决议，请这个人下去。体面的退居二线去养老去。不要再去干预，然后我们这个党有可能调头。如果说这个人不下去，我们这个党没有机会。  
>   
> 这是我想说的第一点。就是说换人，外部环境就会变松。第二，如果说有可能换人，那么我们现在要做的不是我们怎么往前做，而是我们先停止什么，哪些东西不要继续。不是说我们现在再实行什么新政策，就是说你停止就行了。比方说动不动的删微信，以言治罪。这些东西你可以停止吧。我觉得，就是这样。  
>   
> 就是比方说你对民营企业家，动不动就找个罪名就把民营企业家抓进去，抓任志强不算，还把阿拉善的两个主要领导人抓进去了。董国强进去那么多天了，一点消息都没有。然后前两天钱晓华又被他们弄进去了。凭什么他这么做？你抓一个人容易，但是你吓跑了一大批的企业家。所以我们现在可以看到啊，中国的民企很少有人说在这还能赚钱了，大家想到的就是安全第一条。身家性命要保住，能跑的全跑了，资金能走的全走了。有钱的走了，有本事的走了。一大摊子扔下来了。扔下来的是什么，还剩下什么？还能剥夺老百姓利益的高层权贵留在这，喝民血，民脂，民膏。还有就是永远也走不出去的相当大批的贫困的人群。所以我觉得就这两群人是现在还在这，能走的全跑了。那么这个国家还有希望吗，没有希望。  
>   
> 所以说换了人以后，你下来就是停止，你不再做什么，而不是说我们继续要往前再做什么。拨乱反正嘛，这一步必须要做啊。就像当初文革结束以后，拨乱反正，重新来整理。而且这次的清理，就必须是根上，理论上抛弃什么新时代，什么中国特色社会主义理论，那叫胡扯。那个里面逻辑混乱，语言都不通的东西居然拿来当成宗教一样、神一样的东西让全党去学习。我在这说的是很不屑啊。但是我们不能不看到，一个政党，这么大一个国家，这么大一个政党，拿这么一个东西去欺骗，蒙骗九千万人，还有绑架14亿人。让全世界70多亿人笑话中国人民，笑话我们这些个所谓中国共产党的人。  
>   
> 我觉得这是一个政党已经走到穷途末路的一个面目，呈现在全球面前。我觉得像这些都必须要拨乱反正。如果说能做到这几步，下面的事情其实是好办的。因为我们还得相信这个体制里面的绝大多数的党员干部心理是明白什么是对，什么是不对。而现在之所以是这样是因为都被裹挟着往前走，就是说被他裹挟着，你不能不这么干，对不对。我现在老在想啊，这个党的政治僵尸，官员为什么现在老在讲规定动作，什么自选动作，谁敢做，没人敢做自选动作，都在做规定动作。为什么？就是因为那个看齐意识，绝对忠诚。让所有的这些党员干部不敢有自己根据地方实际情况的任何一点实际的做法，谁敢，是吧。找个名目就说你不忠诚，找个名目就说你妄议中央。还敢做吗？这就活活把一个党，一个国家给弄死掉了。  
>   
> 所以我觉得党员干部心里很明白，一旦说请这个人体面下去，我们拨乱反正，党内是没有阻力的。毛那个时候，我们党内还有好多老同志们要思想拐弯，现在不需要拐弯。大家心里很明白，关键就是我们现在高层的那些人有没有这样为党为人民负责的政治勇气。敢不敢迈这一步。 我们都是在这说话的人，我们说话是因为我们没有任何力量去改变它，我们只能自娱自乐吧。说一点，让自己心里痛快点，也就这样啦，是不是。  
>   
> 因为社会你现在也指望不上，他已经把整个中国社会打成原子散沙一盘了，他把所有公民社会，社会的自组织能力全部打散。用警察治国，暴力监控人民。这个社会本身已经不行了。  
>   
> 如果照现在这个状况上来的人一定是个混世魔王，枭雄。所以我觉得呀，还得要讲，这个党内的这些人有没有这个能力来自我挽救，自我救赎一把呀。我觉得是这样。所谓要抛弃体制，中国要所谓用改革这个词来讲来往前走的话，那么仍然希望在于我们这个体制内的这个很多中高层的或者讲我们党内的一些人，因为社会的底层你是不能指望的。这就是我想说的，如果说换了人，我们要干什么，停止做什么。  
>   
> 实际上中国社会不是没有活力的，不是没有生机的，不是没有人才的。你现在摧残社会，摧残思想，摧残全党的这些东西。这个威胁如果解除了，我相信大家都会起来。我们就像在1976年毛去世后的情况，以为中国没路了，是不是。仍然是走过来了。所以要相信这个民族，它是有韧性有生机的。但问题就是这一个人挡住了全国、全党的道路。  
>   
> 那么现在这个状况，我们如果不解决这个人，我们就看着这个体制自由落地吧。等着它自由落体、硬着落，社会崩溃，然后从头开始，我觉得很大的可能性就是这样。我自己个人认为是到今年的年底，明年的上半年，经济会崩到底，那到那时再看，看整个这个国家是啥样的。现在要看外部施加压力，他还能抗一阵子，是吧。钱还没有完全糟蹋光，等到钱都糟蹋光了，然后扛不住了，使国内的矛盾四起的时候，那时候再看吧。所以我觉得我们这一代人，大概在我们活着的时候吧，五年之内，我们还能看到中国还要经历一次大的乱世，这个乱世最后怎么收拾，很难讲。那就是，乱世出枭雄。然后重新再走一轮当初的那段路。

这里是[中国数字时代提供的]( "https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2020/06/translation-former-party-professor-calls-ccp-a-political-zombie/")英文翻译稿：  

> Two major issues–ones that we must dig up from the root–can help explain how we got to where we are today. The first is our system, and the other is our theory. From the perspective of the system, [Xueqin \[historian Zhu Xueqin\]]( "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_Xueqin") said a long time ago: the system used by Mao Zedong to engage in the Cultural Revolution was used by [Deng Xiaoping]( "https://chinadigitaltimes.net/china/deng-xiaoping/") to carry out reforms. After reform and opening up, the market economy was used as a technical tactic to rapidly grow the economy.  
>   
> But the market economy that we are talking about is two-tiered, one is the factor market and the other is the commodity market. Reforms involving factor markets have, to this day, not really moved forward. Therefore, the commodity market that you have cannot be a real commodity market economy. Prices are always controlled and resources are always monopolized because the factor market has not reformed. Why? It has to do with power.  
>   
> So we have not solved the \[main\] problem—that is, our system. With this system, we’ve made it to where we are today, we’ve chosen this individual \[ruler\]—or, I should say, those at the top propped such a person up to the leadership position. What does this tell us? This tells us that this system is going nowhere. It is useless to try and change it. Fundamentally speaking, this system must be abandoned. As for the reform we are talking about, it is no longer about changing within the framework of the current system. This is my primary point. Some people might think when they hear this that we will need to fight a revolution once we abandon this system. That is not the case. This is my first point.  
>   
> The second point is that our theory is fundamentally problematic. Putting aside whether it was correct or not for the Chinese Communist Party to have accepted Marxism-Leninism at the outset–this we are not yet discussing. The fact is, much of this theoretical stuff needs to be  uprooted. Let’s say, for example, that at the time of [our 4000-person congress]( "http://www.yhcqw.com/34/7222.html"), if Deng Xiaoping hadn’t stopped the Party from reflecting on the Cultural Revolution—not only politically denying it but also theoretically abandoning it—then we wouldn’t still be here trying to reverse the verdict on the Cultural Revolution.  
>   
> Because the thing about politics is that it changes over time, it can be overturned one way, and then the other. But if you dig out the theory from its roots, destroying the ideological foundation underneath, then it would be very difficult for this Cultural Revolution business to come back. I therefore feel that, since reform and opening up, we have not solved these two most fundamental problems. One is the system, and the other is the theory. So what do we do now? My personal opinion, how should I put this… If we were to talk about the situation, we should start from the [revision of the constitution]( "https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2017/09/party-constitution-amendment-signal-xis-power/"). From that we would be able to see that the Party is actually already a political zombie.  
>   
> The constitutional amendment is clearly illegal in terms of internal Party procedures. He took the \[last\] Plenum Session of the 18th National Congress of the CCP hostage. Two days before the \[final plenary\] session, he rushed to [throw out the term limit system]( "https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2017/10/xi-launches-second-term-thoughts-charter-no-heir-sight/"). He forced everyone at the \[plenum\] to swallow the revision like he was stuffing dogshit down their throats. So many Central Committee members were at the session, yet not one dared to raise this issue.  
>   
> So, the Party itself is already a political zombie. And this one person, a central leader who has grasped [the knife handle \[police apparatus\], the gun barrel \[military\]]( "https://books.google.ca/books?id=rq7hCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT73&lpg=PT73&dq=knife+handle+gun+barrel+chinese+party&source=bl&ots=WdW1hCU3Q8&sig=ACfU3U1oUS-jmS53t_re4auE4wGhKf92Yg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiVz4vqrvjpAhUoHzQIHQdfCw4Q6AEwDXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=knife%20handle%20gun%20barrel%20chinese%20party&f=false"), and faults within the system itself—that is: one, [corruption]( "https://chinadigitaltimes.net/china/corruption/") among the officials; and two, the lack of human rights and legal protection for Party members and cadres. With these two grasped in his hands, he has turned 90 million Party members into slaves, tools to be used for his personal advantage. When he needs it, he uses the Party. When he doesn’t need it, Party members are no longer treated as Party members. He can easily put you somewhere and label you as a corrupt official.  
>   
> Just take a look at our current situation, at those leading Party cadres who have been dealt with by the National Supervisory Committee recently. I’m not judging whether these people are guilty or not, but that even if they were innocent they will be charged with something. What’s more, the system itself has already corrupted many. The problem is that you should at least check those charges against existing national laws and Party regulations to find out what actions count as violations, and only punish people based on that. Those that are stipulated by national laws—for example, if the crime can be punished under the criminal code—then you can say that so and so has been guilty of this or that crime. Nowadays, not supporting the real economy is a crime, being defiant against the Party is a crime, being dishonest towards the Party is a crime. Where is rule of law? What kind of political party is this? He has become a total mafia boss who can punish his underlings however he wants. That’s why I say that this Party is already a political zombie.  
>   
> In the current state of affairs, it is impossible for anyone to remedy this dangerous situation, not to mention that he \[Xi\] is determined to continue down this path until the end. No matter who speaks, it won’t work. I’ve thought about this problem. When he first came to power, he both covertly and overtly wanted to fan his personality cult in order to improve his prestige. But it didn’t work. Sister \[Ma\] Xiaoli, you may remember, in May of 2016, there was that performance planned at the Great Hall of the People. You [took the lead and resisted, and the whole thing blew up]( "https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1942971/its-trap-daughter-revolutionary-warns-chinas-communist"). The performance was then halted.  
>   
> Next, see what happened in November of 2016? Defiance against the Party was [put into the Party disciplinary code of the Sixth Plenary Session]( "https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2016/07/cadres-face-stricter-rules-party-discipline-becomes-plenum-focus/") of the 18th Central Committee. After that, the [“four consciousnesses” were made into a part of correct political speech]( "http://en.people. cn/n3/2016/0303/c90000-9024163.html"), what we call standard political speech. What “[four self-confidences]( "https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2116836/xi-jinping-thought-communist-partys-tighter-grip-china"),” “four consciousnesses,” and “[two maintenances]( "https://www.scmp.com/comment/letters/article/2184658/i-am-xi-follow-me-doctrine-pushing-china-towards-centralisation")?” Especially the “two maintenances,” about the whole Party revolving around one person. Can you even still call this a political party? It is no longer a political party, and hasn’t been one for a long time. It is just a tool in the hands of a mafia boss.  
>   
> Therefore, this party has become a political zombie. Right now, it is impossible for anyone to come forward and to change it. If it is possible to replace the person, that would be the first step. I think the best solution is of course to replace the person. As a matter of urgency, I think that is the first step. But you can see what he is doing now: holding military power in his hand, holding the entire Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission and the police in his hands. Putting everyone under surveillance using high-tech tools. Who can come out and say “let’s solve this problem”? It’s impossible. Even at the Central Standing Committee meetings, we say majority rule, but does the majority actually rule? No.  
>   
> That’s why I think with this current situation, if \[there is majority rule\] that would, of course, be a good thing. Let me start by saying that if there is a collective resolution from the Standing Committee, with the minority obeying the majority, that you are not doing a good job, that you can’t lead 90 million party members and 1.4 billion people to a dead end to be buried with you, that is not okay. With that said, if these people in the Standing Committee still have a sense of responsibility to the Party, and to the country and the people, then I think these seven Standing Committee members should meet to make a resolution, and just change the person in power. In fact, by changing the person in power, the external environment will start to relax, because this is a signal, telling the outside world that we are moving in a different direction. As long as this person is still in charge, that environment will only get worse, it will not  ease up on us. But if you change the person in power, external tensions will then be capable of being alleviated, because you would then have done a thing that shows that you are able to turn around without having to say a word. This would, I think, be the best thing to happen.  
>   
> But does any member of the Standing Committee have that sense of responsibility to the Party and people? No. Right now, these people can’t even be considered politicians, I think they are just slaves under the command of one person. Of course, my words might suggest that the likes of Wang Yang and Li Keqiang are also included. Actually, they are in a tough spot.  
>   
> They have been doing whatever they can in their positions to minimize losses and alleviate the crisis, we’ve all seen this. In terms of the Party, I wonder whether–be it retired senior cadres or current Standing Committee members–it can rise up once again for the sake of this country and its people and make a majority resolution to ask this person to step down?  Save face, resign from duty, and retire. Don’t intervene anymore. Then, our Party may turn things back around. If this person doesn’t go, then our Party has no chance.  
>   
> This is the first point I wanted to make. That is, as long as we replace him, external pressure will be eased. Second, if replacing him is a possibility, then right now we shouldn’t be thinking about how to move forward, but rather we should prioritize what to stop doing, what are the things we should not continue. We don’t need to implement new policies, we just want you to stop. For example, we should stop deleting WeChat accounts, stop punishing speech. You can stop doing these things, right? This is how I see this.  
>   
> Take entrepreneurs as another example, jailing them at the drop of a hat. Not to even mention the arrest of Ren Zhiqiang, the two leaders of Alashan were also arrested. Dong Guoqiang has disappeared for days, and there has been no news at all. They then arrested Qian Xiaohua just a few days ago. On what grounds was this done? It is easy for you to arrest someone, but you have scared away a large group of entrepreneurs. That’s why what we see now is that very few Chinese private enterprises still talk about making money, everyone is first and foremost concerned about their safety. To protect their livelihoods, those who have the means to flee outside of China and move their assets offshore have already done so. Those with money have already left, those who are capable have left.  What are we left with? We are left with just the blood-sucking red elitists and a large number of poor working people who would never have the means to emigrate. That’s why I think these are the only two groups of people left here, everyone who can leave has already left. Is there still hope for this country? There is no hope.  
>   
> That’s why I say that after his removal, we just need to stop \[these absurd policies\], it’s not about what we need to do going forward. We need to correct past mistakes and set things right–this is a step we must take. Just like when the Cultural Revolution ended, we corrected past mistakes and set things right. But the clean-up this time has to be done from the root. We must completely abandon the theories of the so-called New Era of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics. They are nonsense. For something that does not even make sense logically nor read with any sense of flow, it is preposterous that we are [making the entire Party study them]( "https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2019/02/xi-study-app-highlights-party-influence-over-and-through-tech/") as if they were some kind of a divine text. I am saying all this with disdain. But we simply cannot be blind to the fact that the Party, this enormous Party, and the country is using these lies to indoctrinate 90 million Party members, and hold 1.4 billion Chinese people hostage. It has let Chinese people become the laughing stock of the world, with its 7 billion people laughing at the so-called members of the Chinese Communist Party.  
>   
> This is a sign, presented before the whole world, indicating that the Party is moribund. I believe we must correct our mistakes and set things right.  If there are a few things that we can do, the following are some that can actually be done quite easily. Because we have to believe that the vast majority of Party members know in their hearts what is right and what is wrong. They have had no choice but to go along with him. I have been thinking about the Party’s political zombies, why is it that officials nowadays are always talking about “required actions”? What “voluntary actions”? No one can perform “voluntary actions.” Everyone is performing “required actions.” Why? Because of the notion that one [must toe the line and remain completely loyal]( "https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2016/03/tycoons-silencing-hangs-over-beijings-two-sessions/"). As a result, no Party members or cadres dare to make policies based on local realities. How can you when they can easily find a pretext to label you as disloyal, or defiant of the Party. The Party and the country have been put to death.  
>   
> That’s why I think Party members know what is going on in their hearts. As soon as we ask that person to step down with dignity, we can correct past mistakes and set things right. There should be no resistance from within the Party. In Mao’s era, quite a few senior Party comrades needed to be persuaded, but that’s not the case now. Everyone knows in their hearts what’s going on. The key is whether our high-ranking officials have the political courage to be accountable to the Party and the people. Whether they have the courage to take that step.  
>   
> We are just here talking. We are talking because we have no power to change the system. We can only entertain ourselves, and say things that make us feel better, and that is all, isn’t that right?  
>   
> Because right now society can’t be counted on, he’s already atomized the entire Chinese society into scattered sand. All of [civil society and the capacity for self-organization have been shattered]( "https://chinadigitaltimes.net/china/civil-society/"). Running the country with the police, violently monitoring the people. Society itself is at the point of death.  
>   
> Under the current circumstances, the person who comes into power would without a doubt be a devil incarnate, a ruthless character. That’s why I think we still need to talk about whether these people in the Party are capable of saving themselves, of redeeming themselves. I think this is the case. \[In terms of\] what we are saying about abandoning the system, and about China using the term “reform” to move forward, then hope still lies in the large number of mid and upper-rank members of our Party, or those within the Party, so to speak, because you cannot count on the bottom rung of society. This is what I want to say. If we have this person replaced, what are the things we need to do, what are the things we need to stop doing. \*  
>   
> The fact is, Chinese society is not without vitality. It’s not that we lack energy or talented people. Society is being devastated, the ability to think is being devastated, the Party is being devastated. If this threat can be lifted, I believe everything will get better. Just like in 1976, after Mao’s passing, many believed that was the end for China, yet we’ve come through. That’s why we need to believe in this nation—it is resilient and alive.  However, the problem is that this person has blocked the path forward for the country and the Party.  
>   
> With this current situation, If we don’t get rid of this person, we will witness the political system in free fall. We will wait for a hard landing, for society to collapse, and then start over. I think there is a large likelihood that that is going to happen. I personally think that by the end of this year, or the first half of next year, the economy will completely collapse. When that time comes, we will see what becomes of this country. Although we are feeling a lot of external pressure at this moment, he can probably still weather the storm for a while, because there is still money to squander.

在这里我希望有能力的葱油贡献更多版本的翻译稿然后四处传播，到时候让全世界都能听到这些反习的声音，在这样的加速下，各国政府或许会对中共当局作出更大的压力以促使政变的提前发生。

总加速师千万要坚持住，把党内阴谋集团毫不留情镇压。

“体制自由落地吧。等着它自由落体、硬着落，社会崩溃，然后从头开始，我觉得很大的可能性就是这样。”讲的在理

这表明部分政治精英已经从对现状的不满转变为对体制的绝望，虽然他们仍旧想要挽救体制，但心里却清楚体制已无药可救。我觉得最危险的是，无论当权者也好还是在野派，他们都不知道该怎么解决问题，没有明确的方案，也没有扶大厦将倾的勇气。只能混混日子，得过且过，然后看着泰山崩于眼前，生灵涂炭。这群既无智识，又无担当的蠢货。

是的，没人提出问题的解决方法是恐怖的，因为在此之后那些狂热的毛左等极端主义者会重新登上历史舞台，就像民国军阀混战的混乱时期那样，蔡霞也认为中国会面临这个风险，她在文末这么写的：“五年之内，我们还能看到中国还要经历一次大的乱世，这个乱世最后怎么收拾，很难讲。那就是，乱世出枭雄。然后**重新再走一轮当初的那段路**”，我们一定要警惕那些极端主义者，因为他们会趁着中国共产党硬倒台期间趁虚而入。

很难说，这得看中国大陆怎么对他们定性了，毕竟这位现在的状况还不清楚，如果被软禁了那就坏了  
如果到最后直接定性成709律师案那样的“反革命份子”，那就变“同伙”了，我估计他们很有可能会以这样的结局收尾，毕竟现在包子对异议人士特别敏感，简直是全身都是乳点。

唉，对未来我既抱悲观态度又觉得会有一丝希望。从这几年小粉红现象来看，中国人似乎很吃极端民族主义这一套。如果共产党衰败，势必有枭雄携极端民族主义吸取力量。但胡温十年中国公民社会的蓬勃发展又让我觉得有希望。
