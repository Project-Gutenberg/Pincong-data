2020年11月7日傍晚在德拉華州威明頓市河濱區大通中心舉行了免下車慶祝勝選集會  
The Drive-in Rally at the Chase Center on the Riverfront, in Wilmington, Delaware on November 7, 2020 Evening  
  
候任副總統賀錦麗、後任總統白燈，先後發表了演講。  
  
賀錦麗演講暫無中文譯文。  
  
以下是她勝選演講「奮鬥爭得民主」的英語全文：  
( 出處：[https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-11-07/kamala-harris-victory-speech-2020-election-transcript]( "https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-11-07/kamala-harris-victory-speech-2020-election-transcript") )  
  
Kamala Harris’ victory speech  
  
Good evening.  
  
Congressman John Lewis, before his passing, wrote: “Democracy is not a state. It is an act.”  
  
And what he meant was that America’s democracy is not guaranteed.  
  
It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it, to guard it and never take it for granted.  
  
And protecting our democracy takes struggle.  
  
It takes sacrifice. There is joy in it, and there is progress.  
  
Because “We the People” have the power to build a better future.  
  
And when our very democracy was on the ballot in this election, with the very soul of America at stake, and the world watching, you ushered in a new day for America.  
  
To our campaign staff and volunteers, this extraordinary team: thank you for bringing more people than ever before into the democratic process and for making this victory possible.  
  
To the poll workers and election officials across our country who have worked tirelessly to make sure every vote is counted: our nation owes you a debt of gratitude as you have protected the integrity of our democracy.  
  
And to the American people who make up our beautiful country: thank you for turning out in record numbers to make your voices heard.  
  
I know times have been challenging, especially the last several months.  
  
The grief, sorrow, and pain. The worries and the struggles.  
  
But we’ve also witnessed your courage, your resilience, and the generosity of your spirit.  
  
For four years, you marched and organized for equality and justice, for our lives, and for our planet.  
  
And then, you voted. You delivered a clear message.  
  
You chose hope, unity, decency, science, and, yes, truth.  
  
You chose Joe Biden as the next president of the United States of America.  
  
Joe is a healer. A uniter. A tested and steady hand.  
  
A person whose own experience of loss gives him a sense of purpose that will help us, as a nation, reclaim our own sense of purpose.  
  
And a man with a big heart who loves with abandon.  
  
It’s his love for Jill, who will be an incredible first lady.  
  
It’s his love for Hunter, Ashley, his grandchildren, and the entire Biden family.  
  
And while I first knew Joe as vice president, I really got to know him as the father who loved Beau, my dear friend, who we remember here today.  
  
To my husband Doug, our children Cole and Ella, my sister Maya, and our whole family — I love you all more than I can express.  
  
We are so grateful to Joe and Jill for welcoming our family into theirs on this incredible journey.  
  
And to the woman most responsible for my presence here today — my mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who is always in our hearts.  
  
When she came here from India at the age of 19, maybe she didn’t quite imagine this moment.  
  
But she believed so deeply in an America where a moment like this is possible.  
  
So, I’m thinking about her and about the generations of women — Black women, Asian, white, Latina, and Native American women throughout our nation’s history who have paved the way for this moment tonight.  
  
Women who fought and sacrificed so much for equality, liberty, and justice for all, including the Black women, who are too often overlooked, but so often Prove that they are the backbone of our democracy.  
  
All the women who worked to secure and protect the right to vote for over a century: 100 years ago with the 19th Amendment, 55 years ago with the Voting Rights Act, and now, in 2020, with a new generation of women in our country who cast their ballots and continued the fight for their fundamental right to vote and be heard.  
  
Tonight, I reflect on their struggle, their determination and the strength of their vision — to see what can be unburdened by what has been — I stand on their shoulders.  
  
And what a testament it is to Joe’s character that he had the audacity to break one of the most substantial barriers that exists in our country and select a woman as his vice president.  
  
But while I may be the first woman in this office, I won’t be the last.  
  
Because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.  
  
And to the children of our country, regardless of your gender, our country has sent you a clear message:  
  
Dream with ambition, lead with conviction, and see yourself in a way that others might not see you, simply because they’ve never seen it before.  
  
And we will applaud you every step of the way.  
  
To the American people:  
  
No matter who you voted for, I will strive to be the vice president that Joe was to President Obama — loyal, honest, and prepared, waking up every day thinking of you and your families. Because now is when the real work begins.  
  
The hard work. The necessary work. The good work.  
  
The essential work to save lives and beat this pandemic.  
  
To rebuild our economy so it works for working people.  
  
To root out systemic racism in our justice system and society.  
  
To combat the climate crisis.  
  
To unite our country and heal the soul of our nation.  
  
The road ahead will not be easy.  
  
But America is ready. And so are Joe and I.  
  
We have elected a president who represents the best in us.  
  
A leader the world will respect and our children can look up to.  
  
A commander in chief who will respect our troops and keep our country safe.  
  
And a president for all Americans.  
  
It is now my great honor to introduce the president-elect of the United States of America, Joe Biden.

是時候治愈美利堅了——美國總統當選人白燈勝選演說全文

酒·白燈  
  
國人同胞們，我們的人民已經發聲。他們給我們清楚、明確的勝利，這是「我們人民」的勝利。  
  
我們以7400萬票勝出，這是美國總統史上的最高紀錄。大家給予我的信任和信心，讓我感到謙卑。  
  
我承諾成為一個尋求團結而非分裂的總統。我看到的不是紅州或藍州，而是美國。我將全心努力，贏得全民的信任，因為在美國，重要的是她的人民。我們組成的政府也將以人民為重。  
  
我競選總統，是要找回美國的靈魂，重建我國的骨幹，也就是中產階層，要讓美國在全球再次受到尊重，在國內團結。有數以百萬計的美國民眾為這樣的願景投下一票，是我畢生的榮耀。現在，實現這個願景是我們此刻的工作。  
  
我說過很多次，我是吉兒的丈夫。要不是有吉兒、韓特、艾希莉、我們的孫兒還有他們的配偶以及我們全家人給我的愛和永不倦怠的支持，我就不會站在這裡。他們是我的心之所在。  
  
吉兒是個媽媽，是個「軍媽」，也是個教育工作者。她畢生奉獻教育工作，但教導不只是她的工作，而是她的為人。對美國的教育工作者來說，這是個很棒的日子，你們將在白宮有個自己的人。吉兒會是個很棒的第一夫人。  
  
我將有幸與賀錦麗這位了不起的副總統共事，她將創造歷史，成為我國首次有女性、黑人女性、南亞裔女性或移民的女兒獲選出任正、副元首。  
  
這事老早就應該發生了。這提醒我們今晚要記得多年來為此努力奮鬥的眾人，但美國已再次將道德的曲線掰得更直一些。  
  
卡瑪拉、道格（譯註：賀錦麗與她的丈夫），不管你們喜不喜歡，你們已變成我的家人。你們已變成白燈家族的榮譽成員，不得退出。  
  
全體志工們，你們在疫情之下參與計票工作，還有地方選務官員，我們的國家應該要特別謝謝你們。我的競選團隊，志工們，還有無私奉獻成就這個時刻的每一個人，這一切都要歸功於你們。還有每個支持我們的人，我以我們建立的競選團隊與選戰操作感到光榮。  
  
我以我們組成的聯盟感到驕傲，這是史上最廣泛、最多元的聯盟。有民主黨的、共和黨的，還有無黨籍人士，有進步勢力、中間派還有保守派，有年輕的，有老人，有市區跟郊區民眾，也有人來自鄉村地區，有同志、異性戀者，也有跨性別者，有白人、拉丁美洲裔、亞裔，還有美洲原住民。  
  
特別要紀念我們的選情最低迷的時候，非裔美國民眾再次站起來支持我。他們總是支持我，我也支持你們。我一開始就表明，我的競選要代表美國，我認為我們做到了。我的政府也要長得那樣。  
  
投票給川普總統的選民們，我瞭解你們今晚的失望。我自己也選輸過兩次（譯註：白燈曾在1988年與2008年兩度爭取民主黨總統提名，但未成功），但此刻，讓我們給對方一個機會。這是拋開嚴苛話語的時候，要降溫，再次彼此見面，聆聽對方。如果要進步，我們就必須停止把對手當成敵人。  
  
我們不是敵人，我們都是同胞。聖經教導我們，天下萬物均有定時，建造有時，收割有時，栽種有時，醫治也有時。現在美國醫治療傷的時刻。如今選舉已經結束，人民的意志是什麼？我們被授權要做什麼？  
  
我相信是這個：美國人民要我們集結合宜得體的力量，以及公正的力量，要集結科學與希望的力量，以展開我們這個時代的重要征戰，包括控制疫情、打造繁榮、確保你和家人的醫療照顧、達成種族公平並根除我國制度性的種族歧視、拯救氣候、找回合宜得體的言行、捍衛民主，並且給每個國民公平的機會。  
  
我們的第一件工作，是要控制冠狀病毒疾病的疫情。在使疫情得到控制之前，我們無法修補經濟、恢復我們的活力，也無法享受人生最珍貴的時刻：擁抱孫兒、慶生、參加婚禮、畢典，還有所有對我們最重要的場合。  
  
明天，我將指定一群重要科學家和專家擔任政府過渡期顧問，協助將白燈—賀錦麗計畫轉化成為行動藍圖，在明年1月20日開始實施。那項計畫將以科學為基礎，依憐閔、同理心與關懷的原則規畫。我將竭盡全力，全心承諾扭轉疫情。  
  
我以民主黨員身分光榮參選，我如今將成為美國總統。對於沒有投票給我的人，我也會努力以赴，無異於投票給我的民眾。此時此地，就讓美國妖魔化的灰暗時代開始落幕。民主黨興共和黨拒絕相互合作的原因，並非某種我們無法控制的神祕力量。它是個決定，是我們所做的選擇。如果我們可以決定不合作，我們就可以決定合作。我相信這是美國人民授權我們要做的事情之一。他們要我們合作。這就是我要做的選擇，我籲請國會民主黨與共和黨議員跟我做一樣的選擇。  
  
美國故事，是機會緩慢但穩定擴充的故事。不要搞錯，太多夢想被推遲太久。我們必須讓每個人都能實現美國的承諾，不論他們的人種、族裔、信仰、認同或有何殘疾。  
  
美國始終被轉折點所形塑，也就是在一些時間點，我們思考自己是什麼樣的人，又想成為什麼樣的人，然後做出困難的決定。林肯在1860年決定維護國家的完整，羅斯福總統在1932年為陷入困境的美國承諾推行新政，甘迺迪總統在1960年承諾新境界，12年前，歐巴馬在創造歷史的時候，他告訴我們：「是的，我們做得到。」  
  
我們再次處在一個轉折。我們有機會打敗絕望，建立繁榮、有目標的國家。我們做得到，我知道可以。我很早就談到要為美國的靈魂而奮鬥。我們必須找回美國的靈魂。  
  
形塑我們國家的，是我們的善良天使跟我們最黑暗的衝動之間不斷發生的征戰。此刻，我們善良的天使要得勝。今晚，全世界都在看著美國，我相信美國表現最好的時候，是全球的明燈。我們的領導，靠的不是我們實力的展示，而是靠我們做為榜樣的力量。我始終相信，若要用一個單字來定義美國，必定是「可能性」。在美國，每個人都應該有機會追尋夢想，將神所賜予的能力發揮到淋漓盡致。對，我相信這個國家的可能性。  
  
我們眼光總是向前看，盼望一個更自由、更公正的美國，一個用品格、尊重來創造工作機會的美國，一個可以治療諸如癌症、阿茲海默症等疾病的美國，一個不放棄任何一人的美國，一個不輕言放棄、屈服的美國。這是偉大的國家，我們是良善的一群，這是美利堅合眾國，當我們攜手團結，就沒有辦不到的事。  
  
選戰進入最後倒數階段的時候，我腦海不斷想著一首對我和家人很重要的讚美詩，尤其是我已故的兒子波伊（Beau）。這首讚美詩體現給我支撐的信仰，我深信它也支撐著美國。  
  
我希望，這也將對今年因恐怖病毒而失去摯愛的23萬個家庭提供些許慰藉。我心惦念著你們大家，希望這首讚美詩也能給你們安慰。  
  
「祂要將你升高乘鷹翅膀，背負你黎明翱翔，要你明亮如太陽，將你緊握在主慈手中。」現在，大家一起在鷹翅之上，展開神和歷史召喚我們從事的工作。藉著虔誠的心、穩健的手以及對美國和彼此的信心，藉著愛國的心和對正義的渴望，讓我們的國家達到我們自知可以達到的境界：一個團結的國家，一個強化的國家，一個癒合的國家，美利堅合眾國。  
  
神保佑大家，願神保佑我們的部隊。

酒·白燈勝選演講英文全文如下：( 出處：酒·白燈競選官方網站 [https://joebiden.com/presidency-for-all-americans]( "https://joebiden.com/presidency-for-all-americans") )  
  
This Is the Time to Heal America - Joe Biden’s victory speech after winning the presidential election  
  
My fellow Americans —  
  
The people of this nation have spoken.  
  
They have delivered us a clear victory. A convincing victory.  
  
A victory for “We the People.”  
  
We have won with the most votes ever cast for a presidential ticket in the history of this nation — 74 million.  
  
I am humbled by the trust and confidence you have placed in me.  
  
I pledge to be a President who seeks not to divide, but to unify.  
  
Who doesn’t see Red and Blue states, but a United States.  
  
And who will work with all my heart to win the confidence of the whole people.  
  
For that is what America is about: The people.  
  
And that is what our Administration will be about.  
  
I sought this office to restore the soul of America.  
  
To rebuild the backbone of the nation — the middle class.  
  
To make America respected around the world again and to unite us here at home.  
  
It is the honor of my lifetime that so many millions of Americans have voted for this vision.  
  
And now the work of making this vision real is the task of our time.  
  
As I said many times before, I’m Jill’s husband.  
  
I would not be here without the love and tireless support of Jill, Hunter, Ashley, all of our grandchildren and their spouses, and all our family.  
  
They are my heart.  
  
Jill’s a mom — a military mom — and an educator.  
  
She has dedicated her life to education, but teaching isn’t just what she does — it’s who she is.  
  
For America’s educators, this is a great day: You’re going to have one of your own in the White House, and Jill is going to make a great First Lady.  
  
And I will be honored to be serving with a fantastic vice president — Kamala Harris — who will make history as the first woman, first Black woman, first woman of South Asian descent, and first daughter of immigrants ever elected to national office in this country.  
  
It’s long overdue, and we’re reminded tonight of all those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. But once again, America has bent the arc of the moral universe towards justice.  
  
Kamala, Doug — like it or not — you’re family. You’ve become honorary Bidens and there’s no way out.  
  
To all those who volunteered, worked the polls in the middle of this pandemic, local election officials — you deserve a special thanks from this nation.  
  
To my campaign team, and all the volunteers, to all those who gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible, I owe you everything.  
  
And to all those who supported us: I am proud of the campaign we built and ran. I am proud of the coalition we put together, the broadest and most diverse in history.  
  
Democrats, Republicans and Independents.  
  
Progressives, moderates and conservatives.  
  
Young and old.  
  
Urban, suburban and rural.  
  
Gay, straight, transgender.  
  
White. Latino. Asian. Native American.  
  
And especially for those moments when this campaign was at its lowest — the African American community stood up again for me. They always have my back, and I’ll have yours.  
  
I said from the outset I wanted a campaign that represented America, and I think we did that. Now that’s what I want the administration to look like.  
  
And to those who voted for President Trump, I understand your disappointment tonight.  
  
I’ve lost a couple of elections myself.  
  
But now, let’s give each other a chance.  
  
It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric.  
  
To lower the temperature.  
  
To see each other again.  
  
To listen to each other again.  
  
To make progress, we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy.  
  
We are not enemies. We are Americans.  
  
The Bible tells us that to everything there is a season — a time to build, a time to reap, a time to sow. And a time to heal.  
  
This is the time to heal in America.  
  
Now that the campaign is over — what is the people’s will? What is our mandate?  
  
I believe it is this: Americans have called on us to marshal the forces of decency and the forces of fairness. To marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time.  
  
The battle to control the virus.  
  
The battle to build prosperity.  
  
The battle to secure your family’s health care.  
  
The battle to achieve racial justice and root out systemic racism in this country.  
  
The battle to save the climate.  
  
The battle to restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot.  
  
Our work begins with getting COVID under control.  
  
We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life’s most precious moments — hugging a grandchild, birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us — until we get this virus under control.  
  
On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as Transition Advisors to help take the Biden-Harris COVID plan and convert it into an action blueprint that starts on January 20th, 2021.  
  
That plan will be built on a bedrock of science. It will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern.  
  
I will spare no effort — or commitment — to turn this pandemic around.  
  
I ran as a proud Democrat. I will now be an American president. I will work as hard for those who didn’t vote for me — as those who did.  
  
Let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end — here and now.  
  
The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control.  
  
It’s a decision. It’s a choice we make.  
  
And if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate from the American people. They want us to cooperate.  
  
That’s the choice I’ll make. And I call on the Congress — Democrats and Republicans alike — to make that choice with me.  
  
The American story is about the slow, yet steady widening of opportunity.  
  
Make no mistake: Too many dreams have been deferred for too long.  
  
We must make the promise of the country real for everybody — no matter their race, their ethnicity, their faith, their identity, or their disability.  
  
America has always been shaped by inflection points — by moments in time where we’ve made hard decisions about who we are and what we want to be.  
  
Lincoln in 1860 — coming to save the Union.  
  
FDR in 1932 — promising a beleaguered country a New Deal.  
  
JFK in 1960 — pledging a New Frontier.  
  
And twelve years ago — when Barack Obama made history — and told us, “Yes, we can.”  
  
We stand again at an inflection point.  
  
We have the opportunity to defeat despair and to build a nation of prosperity and purpose.  
  
We can do it. I know we can.  
  
I’ve long talked about the battle for the soul of America.  
  
We must restore the soul of America.  
  
Our nation is shaped by the constant battle between our better angels and our darkest impulses.  
  
It is time for our better angels to prevail.  
  
Tonight, the whole world is watching America. I believe at our best America is a beacon for the globe.  
  
And we lead not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.  
  
I’ve always believed we can define America in one word: Possibilities.  
  
That in America everyone should be given the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them.  
  
You see, I believe in the possibility of this country.  
  
We’re always looking ahead.  
  
Ahead to an America that’s freer and more just.  
  
Ahead to an America that creates jobs with dignity and respect.  
  
Ahead to an America that cures disease — like cancer and Alzheimers.  
  
Ahead to an America that never leaves anyone behind.  
  
Ahead to an America that never gives up, never gives in.  
  
This is a great nation.  
  
And we are a good people.  
  
This is the United States of America.  
  
And there has never been anything we haven’t been able to do when we’ve done it together.  
  
In the last days of the campaign, I’ve been thinking about a hymn that means a lot to me and to my family, particularly my deceased son Beau. It captures the faith that sustains me and which I believe sustains America.  
  
And I hope it can provide some comfort and solace to the more than 230,000 families who have lost a loved one to this terrible virus this year. My heart goes out to each and every one of you. Hopefully this hymn gives you solace as well.  
  
“And He will raise you up on eagle’s wings,  
  
Bear you on the breath of dawn,  
  
Make you to shine like the sun,  
  
And hold you in the palm of His Hand.”  
  
And now, together — on eagle’s wings — we embark on the work that God and history have called upon us to do.  
  
With full hearts and steady hands, with faith in America and in each other, with a love of country — and a thirst for justice — let us be the nation that we know we can be.  
  
A nation united.  
  
A nation strengthened.  
  
A nation healed.  
  
The United States of America.  
  
God bless you.  
  
And may God protect our troops.

說支那人一向不識好歹說錯了麽？根本沒，就這，非常客觀的一個事情，無論你踩上我幾脚，它都早已客觀發生了，我只是轉發視頻而已。啥叫不識好歹，這就是！啥叫混賬，你們即是！你們自個證明了你們是混蛋、二逼！  
  
爲什麽呢？即便最兇惡敵人，你都先客觀瞭解其觀點，然後再仇視和對敵他吧，正如電影教父中一句話：Never hate your enemies,or it'll affect your judgement. 別讓對敵仇恨，影響了你的判斷。這可好，把川皇當成毛來崇尚，把白當成劉少奇來仇視，對於客觀忠實轉發其演講視頻者，也要狠狠地踏上兩脚，讓其永世不得翻身，轉發並未携帶任何個人觀點，就平白無故遭川小兵們踐踏，知好歹麽？一群混賬而已！

那你也没有先客观了解点踩者们的观点然后再仇视和对敌他们啊  
我估计是因为“候任副总统”“侯任总统”“胜选演说”等用词实际上就表明了你的个人观点吧

2016 年，多数美国人选择了川普总统，你们羞辱了 4 年。  
  
2020 年，在还没有确定取得政权的时候，你们说要 Build back。  
  
问题来了，为什么你们可以说：not my president, 而其他人不可以 ？  
  
如果没有你们的破坏，何必 build back ?  
  
so credit go to ?

拜托！2016 年川普當選時我老人家興奮得為他歡呼了，因爲他是一個政治素人，當時我為他打敗了希拉蕊(克林頓夫人)而高興，當時在2016年希拉蕊還沒承認敗選時，我就按著美國慣例來稱呼他為候任總統(President-Elect)了，President-Elect Joe Biden 候任總統白燈 亦是當前美國傳媒慣例，譬如保守右傾的華爾街日報：Ask WSJ: Next Steps for President-Elect Joe Biden 華爾街日報向讀者徵求對候任總統白燈的問題～ [https://www.wsj.com/live-qa/ask-wsj-next-steps-for-president-elect-joe-biden/B9E48096-CD6F-4EAB-A026-311FD9FF1DE2]( "https://www.wsj.com/live-qa/ask-wsj-next-steps-for-president-elect-joe-biden/B9E48096-CD6F-4EAB-A026-311FD9FF1DE2")

美國和世界大多數傳媒都在按慣例這麽稱呼 President-elect Joe Biden & Vice President-elect Kamala Harris “候任總統”白燈 和 “候任副總統”何錦麗啊？

上邊就是這麽寫的啊～ 勝選演說全文  
英明的你，智商特漂亮的你，請告訴我，這不叫勝選演說，又該叫什麽呢？2016年時也是在Face貼出了川普的11月勝選演講，他次年1月就職那叫做當選演講，這幾個稱謂“候任總統”“候任副總”“勝選演講”全地球通用，很客觀，沒丁點問題吧？誰會發帖還沒成想，沒成想竟沒照顧到你們那小氣粑粑的玻璃心呢！！！這就是你們紅小兵 僞裝出來的所謂 言論自由 ？小肚鷄腸一至於此……

已被打壓到沒法做新回復了，只好編輯舊回復新增一下：  
  
你們的所謂言論自由呢，就是動輒絲毫不給理由就折叠、觀察、封號…… 不就這點能耐麽…… 怕真話怕得其會影響了你們的洗腦大業，難道不是麽？！  
我是根本沒啥「受不了」「鷄凍」「攻击整体中国人」——這些統統是你們用五毛式臆斷憑空給我安上來的，都是硬扣到我頭上的帽子…… 你哪只眼看到我攻擊了整體中國人呢？你們五毛版主和肆意踐踏我的那倆人竟能呆婊「整体中国人」？巨嬰們，能讓你們看不慣的多著呢，不僅僅什麽候任總統和勝選演說呢！你們都玻璃心懟，多累啊… 我也是好心好言，勸勸兒等，算了，不識好歹咋說都白搭…… 究其實呢，是我據實揭穿了你們慣用下三濫壓制手法：告知你們踩踏者是自個證明了自個是混蛋，對的，自證為混賬，就像「内容被折叠」所言…… 你們說不過就把我打成了「觀察」，再進一步就封掉我發言權了…… 我仔細看了，所有被你們封掉的賬號都是講理的，譬如排名前三的那幾個被你們污為五毛的人，是用五毛手法去打擊講真話的人，硬用臆想來揣度他人，論壇操控心思全用在怎麽用專制手段修理好言告知的人或言論上了，這要還不是五毛論壇，那就沒什麽五毛論壇了。  
從來就沒怕過你們踩，請翻翻我之前的帖子，連昨個也同樣轉發台灣評論的帖，都一下子被無理踩了更多脚呢…… 還什麽「受不了」「鷄凍」「攻击整体中国人」…… 你們真是生不逢時啊，要是趕到毛時代，這樣子胡扣帽子可是把鬥爭好手呢，毛的好刀子、好孩子呢……

我只是好奇进来看一下的，因为总体来说品葱发Biden/Harris阵营的东西不多。  
不明白你为什么这么激动，被点踩既不会让有财务损失，也不会让你在论坛禁言，顶多说明有两位葱友不喜欢你转发的内容而已，你对点踩的人做的假设有点太多了，你怎么知道人家就不了解他们的观点了呢？  
但是你就从这发散到攻击整体中国人就过了，没有依据，而且没有必要。  
还有，说品葱是五毛网站，我真是笑死了。如果你是对的，那你来一个五毛网站干什么？

川普特爛，特無德無能，是他自個做出來的。  
2016年時，我爲他歡呼、為他加油，如果2020年還在為他歡呼還在粉他，那我就四六不懂了，就罔人命了，就跟他一樣毫不在乎地不把美國人民的人命關天當回事了，那我還算是個人麽？！  
  
誰都跟他沒冤沒仇的，也不恨他，就是他太爛了，客觀而已，他自個做出來的而已。毛澤東，如果他不是害死和殺死那麽多人，殺人害命啊，我又何必損他呢？愛獨裁，恨獨裁，損獨裁，都各有其理由，只要客觀存在，都不會對你們玻璃心造成多大損失，是吧？誰也更沒把你們當成敵人。幹嘛非把人家踩到最後無法發言爲止呢，你們自個制定的規矩：踩多了就跟反動分子一樣失去發言資格。但你得有理由去踐踏才行啊，做人要有底綫啊，發個帖，所有用詞都是全地球通用，沒夾帶任何個人觀點，你們上來就踩，這種巨嬰行爲比川普的耍賴般無理取鬧還下流呢…… 不是有意冒犯你們。僅是實話實說而已。

魯迅是毛所最愛的左膠…  
  
  
用之前跟不會講漢語的美國出生移民二代臉書交流，來簡單回復一下帶有魯迅頭像者提問：  
  
Q:  
  
可以详细的解释一下，怎样的烂和无德无能吗 ？怎样的不把美國人民的人命關天當回事。  
  
A:  
  
Is Trump most effective to oppose Communist China?  
Xi said that he is more willing to deal with Trump, because Trump emphasizes the exchange of interests or the art of the deals, and is so careless of human rights. Xi prefers Trump, just as same as that Mao prefers Nixon.  
June 14, 2019, Trump particularly delayed Pence’s Tiananmen speech in hopes of landing Xi meeting - what a soft-line for China!  
At least, Joe Biden stated about Xi with a hard-line: "This is a guy who doesn't have a democratic - with a small 'd' - bone in his body, this is a guy who is a thug."  
After all as a president who ever was a businessman, Trump is relatively unconcerned with staking out a moral high ground, or criticizing other countries’ corruption or failings regarding human rights and democracy. The “America first” president is in some respects not only amenable to the People’s Republic of China, one could go so far as to argue that he is the first American president with “Chinese characteristics”.  
A Chinese scholar who is politically moderate confided privately that he “likes Trump very much,” in part because of his similarities to Xi. “China’s proposed ‘national rejuvenation’ and Trump’s ‘Make America great again’ are the same,” he said. In fact, one could make the case that the slogan Xi embraced as the core of his Chinese dream anticipated Trump’s. Though its official translation is “The great revival of the Chinese nation,” an equally accurate rendition would be “Make China great again.”  
“In the history of mankind, only two people have proposed that the masses must overthrow the social establishment, one is Mao Zedong, the other is Trump.” a Trump’s Chinese fans said. Undoubtedly Trump’s nationalist rhetoric and “strongman style” resonate strongly in China’s political culture.  
No surprise that the most of western people do not like comrade Build-the-Country Trump, but the most of Chinese people love him.  
The most of Chinese people perhaps neither identify what is good or bad, nor recognize what is true or fake;  
they are often self-righteous, and don't care about the true state of dealing with people or affairs;  
certainly they would eat a stinky shit as sweet cake...  
It seems that the Chinese trumpsters are even more than the American trumpsters. Trump is indeed more suitable to be a leader of a Chinese country (PRC, ROC, Hongkong), but not suitable to be a leader of a Western country.  
  
At this moment in the USA,  
about 1 million new cases of Covid-19 in one week ( [https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/11/11/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/]( "https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/11/11/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/") ),  
more than 10.5 million people were the patients, included Mr. Trump and his wife, and more than 242 thousand people had died with this disease, - the coronavirus deaths now already far surpass the total numbers of US troops' deaths that during all the wars since the Korean War, and the vast numbers of Americans died mainly because their president and government were incompetent;  
nearly half population is without a job and with lack of money, 1 in 9 people struggles with hunger, 1 in 7 children struggles with hunger;  
in despair during the pandemic,  
more than 40 percent of adults were struggling with mental health, more than one-quarter of young adults said they have seriously contemplated suicide;  
13 percent have begun or increased substance abuse, and the drug addicts' relapses at least have increased 50 percent...  
At the end of last month, the White House science office went beyond Trump’s now-standard claims that the Americans are “rounding the corner” on the coronavirus and declared that one of the administration’s major achievements was “ending the Covid-19 pandemic.” Who was that supposed to convince, when almost everyone is aware not only that the pandemic continues, but that coronavirus cases and hospitalizations are surging? All it did was make Trump look even more out of touch.  
What were the lies, damned lies and Trump rallies?  
“It’s going to disappear, one day - it’s like a miracle - it will disappear.”  
"It’s going to go away. BECAUSE OF WHAT I DID."  
"It is what it is."  
"It affects virtually nobody"  
"We are rounding the turn. 99.9%."  
...  
The above lies came from comrade Donald.  
Lies, corruption, anger, chaos, incompetence, decay, ... all are the key words of his usual dictatorial manner.  
Do you believe that Biden or other politician who has a bit of conscience would be such as Trump to disregard for the lives and healths of his compatriots?  
Donald Trump absolutely is the worst U.S. president ever, no other one else is worse than him. He indeed is the embodiment of a democratic dictator under a democratic system, he totally is a man unworthy of the office he holds.  
A president, who has no duties, responsibilities and qualities as a public servant of the people, who cares about nothing but only himself, and who has no bottom line, no matter what petty profits or benefits he brings to his supporters, cannot offset the declines of a powerful free country and the harms caused by losing democracy to dictatorship due to his abuses of power.
