先当成假设来看待。  
  
消息若属实，想要维尼那条命的「人」又多了一个。  
  
凡加速主义者，不想伟大事业荒废的，要开始物色总加速师2.0了。  
  
[多伦多媒体消息]( "https://www.torontotoday.net/2020/08/15/vladimir-putins-daughter-dies-after-second-dose-of-covid-vaccine/")：

>   
> **Vladimir Putin’s daughter suffered unexpected side effects to the experimental Russian COVID vaccine, and has passed away in Moscow**. The Kremlin has yet to make a statement on her death. **A source within Russia’s inner circle stated that Putin’s daughter – Katerina Tikhonova – suffered a rise in temperature shortly after her second injection, and then suffered a seizure.** **Doctors were not able to reverse the side-effects of the vaccine, and she was pronounced dead late yesterday evening.**  
>   
> The Russian vaccine is named Sputnik V, after the first artificial satellite, launched into space by the Russians in 1957. It is also noteworthy that Sputnik is the name of Russia’s International News Station, which has been accused of being a propaganda wing of the Kremlin.  
>   
> Prior to Katerina’s death, Russian Doctor Sergei Tsarenko stated that releasing the vaccine early was the better out of 2 options. In his opinion, it was better just to move ahead, as opposed to letting people die.  
>   
> However, Western doctors were fearful of Russia bypassing stage 3 trials and rushing the drug to market, warning it could have devastating effects.  
>   
> Abram L. Wagner, Professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan had this to say on a rushed COVID-19 vaccine.  
>   
> Now it appears, Katerina Tikhonova is the first official fatality of the Russian COVID-19 vaccine. Proving that Sputnik V was not safe, and skipping stage 3 trials was a misguided move on the Kremlin’s part.  
>   
> The Kremlin is known to spread disinformation, so it is likely it will lie about Putin’s daughter’s death, or else blame her death on something other than the vaccine.

  
只说一下简要意思。  
  
因为俄罗斯的试验性COVID疫苗出现副作用，普京的女儿在莫斯科死亡。克里姆林宫尚未发出声明。  
  
来自俄罗斯高层圈内的消息指出，在第二次注射后，**Katerina Tikhonova**很快出现发热，病情急剧恶化，医生于8月14日晚宣告她死亡。  
  
她是第一例俄罗斯COVID疫苗的死亡，证明了「卫星五号」并不安全。跳过第三期，是克里姆林宫需要负全责的错误。  
  
\--------------------------------------  
老实说，可靠性存疑，这一消息很难说不是编造，不过先采信好了。  
  
如果普京的女儿是因为感染后才仓促注射疫苗，那就可以解释为什么普京这么着急，让疫苗跳过三期。  
  
如果不是这个原因，而是普京出于挽救自己的权威出发，让Katerina Tikhonova成为牺牲品的话，普京也不会把罪全归在自己身上。  
  
所以，上述两种情况无论哪一种，都会导致维尼的睡眠质量真正变差。  
  
动物保护主义的支持者们，现在是站出来为熊呐喊，替熊挡子弹的时候了。真的。

这涉及到克里姆林宫的权威，恐怕事实与否，这件事都不会有后续。。。除非他也想玩个“转嫁危机”
