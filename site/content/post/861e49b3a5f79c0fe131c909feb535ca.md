“我的英雄”，阿恩在朝鲜战争纪念日7月27日的视频  
In My Hero, a segment about Un A’s grandfather, a veteran of the 1950-53 Korean War, she identifies herself as “an ordinary Korean girl from an ordinary family.”  
一段名为《我的英雄》(My Hero)的视频是关于她祖父的，他是1950–1953年朝鲜战争的退役老兵，片中她说自己是“一个来自普通家庭的普通朝鲜女孩”。  
Then she launches into a monologue hewing relentlessly to the grand theme of all North Korean propaganda — how the Kim family liberated Koreans from the yoke of Japanese colonialists, repelled American invaders in the Korean War and made North Koreans safe once and for all by developing a nuclear deterrent.  
然后她开始了一段独白，毫不偏离所有朝鲜宣传的宏大主题——金氏家族如何从日本殖民统治者手里解放了朝鲜，在朝鲜战争中击败了美国侵略者，并通过研发核威慑力让朝鲜人得到了最终的安全保障。  
“We don’t have to wander around in search for a shelter, we don’t have to bend knees pleading for peace, and we don’t have to run from gunfire,” she says.  
“我们不必四处寻找避难所，我们不必屈膝祈求和平，我们也不必躲避炮火，”她说。  
She does not mention that the war was started by the North’s invasion of South Korea and was halted in a stalemate after costing millions of lives.  
她没有提朝鲜战争是因为朝鲜入侵韩国而爆发的，在造成数百万人死亡、打成僵局后停火。from nyt  
这个视频我同桌是一个歪果仁推荐给我的，有一天他到学校带来一张打印稿上面印着这篇文章，个人兴趣自己找到了视频呈现给大家。

靠贵州省遵义地区水平的经济总量养一支庞大军队还要开发核武器和弹道导弹，还有钱吃饭才怪。

呵呵，一帮鸡鸣狗盗之徒！要我说，美国没少帮助这帮乐色！美国如果还是民主国家，一定要灭掉这帮无耻之徒。如果3年内完不成任务，我想我本人也会加入浩浩荡荡的反美行列！如果像我这样的人都要反美了，那世界确实到了清洗的时候了！不信你们可以调查我是什么样的人！

全文鉴赏：  
**I am an ordinary korean girl**  
  
I am an ordinary korean girl from an ordinary family  
  
this is my grandfather, he was not a hero but a brave soldier, a war veteran I'm so proud of  
  
now I'm old enough to realize the battle stories he used to tell me and the people he used to recall were part of the history.  
  
now I see how his generation lived through the most fierce and painful years of war for all  
no one wanted a war, that brought agony to every life on this land but a war we had to win at any cost, the fatherland liberation war.  
  
and I'm here today as I did last year, and a year before last by my family tradition  
  
just today I'm sure of my own and he's not here with me anymore  
but this is where the heroes patriots and veterans are alive to tell us the truth.  
  
on June 25th 1950, early Sunday morning, peace was broken on Korean peninsula  
and there was no way for Koreans to stand back.  
  
in population territory economy and military equipment the two years old republic  
and the formed coalition forces could not be a match.  
  
and no one expected the war would last as long as 1129 days  
and would go into history as the fiercest and the most brutal war since the second world war  
  
innumerable innocent people killed and not a single brick remained intact.  
  
still it was the Koreans who became the winner.  
  
we call it victory because we successfully defended our land from the invasion by the strongest allied forces in the world.  
  
they disposed all its power to take over this tiny land but what they faced was a total shameful failure  
  
literally it was a duel between a rifle and an atom bomb  
  
the war had turned every citizen of the republic into a hero and they had their reason to become one.  
  
for five dreamy years liberated from Japanese colony,  
farmers finally owned their land, workers became masters of factory  
and parents could send their children to school  
  
and people was ready to sacrifice anything to protect what they just gained the freedom, the democracy and their genuine life  
  
and they had the right leader the brilliant commander in his 30's  
who could lead their patriotism to a victory.  
  
so now I want to know the history better and thank them for what they have achieved  
just most of them are already gone.  
  
but this is what's left after them, the nation, the land, the freedom that I can call my life  
  
we don't have to wander around and search for a shelter  
  
we don't have to bend knees pleading for peace  
  
and we don't have to run from gunfire  
  
my grandfather taught me to value the history  
and he taught me to defend what's precious for

全篇文字十分煽情～ 美帝亡我之心不死的套路。  
人民英勇奋战+伟大领袖的带领，最终成功的保卫了祖国，击退了美帝。  
  
好奇的是他们为什么提到了5年的「美好的日本殖民时期」朝鲜有被日本殖民过吗？我还真不知道。还有这么煽情的宣传视频，从头到尾也没有提国中国的帮忙，倒是咱们老跟这儿没完没了的宣传「抗美援朝」。  
我想CCP要是看到这个，心里一定是“拔凉拔凉“的吧。
