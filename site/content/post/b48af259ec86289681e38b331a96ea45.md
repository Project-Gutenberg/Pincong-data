[https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/chinese-dissident-chen-guangcheng-to-speak-at-republican-convention]( "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/chinese-dissident-chen-guangcheng-to-speak-at-republican-convention")  
  
Chinese dissident lawyer Chen Guangcheng will speak at the [Republican National Convention]( "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/republican-convention"), the _Washington Examiner_ has learned.  
  
  
Chen, a blind man known as "[the barefoot lawyer]( "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/blind-political-dissident-to-us-officials-demand-human-rights-in-china")" who denounced China’s forced abortion policies and advocated for people with disabilities, received asylum in the United States in 2012 after escaping house arrest.  
  
His appearance calls attention to the Chinese Communist Party's human rights abuses as well as the fraught [state of U.S.-China relations]( "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-china-will-own-the-united-states-if-biden-wins"), which could be a potent political weapon due to general anger over the coronavirus pandemic and President Trump's dependence on socially conservative voters.  
  
“As the 'barefoot 'lawyer,' he sought justice for those who could not stand up to the repressive communist government on their own and won the admiration of the world for his sense of fairness and his crusade for freedom,” said Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation Executive Director Marion Smith when her organization awarded him the Truman-Reagan Medal of Freedom in 2015.  
  
  
Chen’s addition to the schedule comes as Trump seeks to turn his administration’s confrontational approach with China into a winning campaign message.  
  
“Just In: Chinese State Media and Leaders of CHINA want Biden to win ‘the U.S. Election,’” Trump [tweeted]( "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1298637609871212545") Wednesday morning. “If this happened (which it won’t), China would own our Country, and our Record Setting Stock Markets would literally CRASH!”  
  
That tweet echoes a [U.S. intelligence assessment]( "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/china-prefers-trump-lose-while-russia-seeks-to-undermine-biden-us-intelligence-community-says") that China would prefer Trump to lose to Joe Biden this fall. The assessment also concluded, on the other hand, “that Russia is using a range of measures to denigrate” Biden.  
  
Republican officials have seized on the dearth of anti-China rhetoric at the Democratic National Convention to argue that Biden would neglect threats emanating from Beijing.  
  
"The fact that Joe Biden, in his speech last night, never mentioned China was truly remarkable,” Vice President Mike Pence [said]( "https://www.newsweek.com/pence-criticizes-dnc-paying-no-attention-china-blm-protests-1526769") last week.

@pcuser123: 因为民主党鼓励堕胎和陈的为堕胎维权的经历相违背，没法走在一起的

Biden says Chinese activist's future is in America  
May 6, 2012 3:30 p.m.  
  
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Joe Biden says he believes that Chinese legal activist Chen Guangcheng's future is in the United States.  
  
Chen, who escaped house arrest and fled to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, has a tentative deal with the Chinese government to study in the U.S. and bring his family. He has an invitation to come to New York University.  
  
Biden tells NBC's "Meet the Press" that U.S. officials "expect the Chinese to stick to that commitment."  
  
Biden says that when Chen came to the embassy, he wanted to be reunited with his family and remain in China -- just not in his village. Biden says that was arranged, but when Chen left the embassy for a hospital, he had a change of mind and "we got to work."

看到推特上海外民运人士骂陈先生那个恶毒，这些人真是乌合之众。

2012年我在某个论坛看到了陈光诚被拯救的报道，让人特别高兴，记得其中一个主要的营救者还是个女英雄——珍珠。  
  
对于那些骂陈光诚的，只能无语，一群乌合之众。

看来这次彭斯是主策划，昨天一个堕胎主题，今天又是堕胎主题，不知道接下来是不是有维族强制上环主题的

一个盲人、律师，做的又是维护那些被计划生育的人的权利，这个形象本身就非常有个性，能让观众印象深刻，而且符合共和党的理念，又揭了中共的皮，不得不说共和党和很会请人，健全的民主人士的感染力肯定没有他来得强！

dnc比rnc先开的吧  
  
dnc如果把他们认为没被中共策反的海外反共人士请去发言，还轮得到rnc沾光吗？

海外民小一个左派都没有，而过去右派都是和中共勾搭做生意的。  
  
可以说川普是海外民小的大救星，他们从克林顿时期苦等了20多年，终于等到了保守派也开始反华了。  
  
但是，就算是当招财童子，民小依然不会得到左派主流媒体的认可。未来，恐怕只有VOA依然是他们发梦的小圈子。  
  
不过，这一切我相信未来都已经不太重要了。因为人类已经开启了新纪元，当中国人还在争取300年前古老的人权，别人早已经打算离开这里了。

巴丟草之流的垃圾在大聲嚷嚷中，自以為對社會有堅持有信念，但其實所堅持就跟共產主義一樣，只能想不能用。
