怎么跟支那那么像呢，打不过法国就拿澳大利亚出气，专捏软柿子？

TLDR: 澳洲一公民在卡塔尔被拘捕并进行非人道（摸到不可以摸的地方）的搜身

我不觉得是拿澳洲出气。  
  
我觉得那些澳洲公民，十有八九是原籍黎巴嫩或叙利亚的难民。  
  
首先，目前澳洲在封国中，普通澳洲人是无法飞出国门的，除非受到豁免，比如海外有亲人急事。普通澳人亲人都在澳洲，没有海外联系。前段时间黎巴嫩大爆炸，豁免了很多黎巴嫩人出境参加葬礼之类的急事。同时会在卡塔尔转机的，很大可能是到中东其他国家的。欧洲国家目前疫情比澳洲严重，不会有人去的。  
  
其次，一般人到了怀孕后期，大肚子在登机时就会被发现了，没被发现的原因肯定是因为包着穆斯林大袍。  
  
再次，如果是白人的话，中东机场人员不会这么放肆，把手伸到女性下体直接查看。白人也不会放纵别人对自己这么放肆。一群人都被摸了。是普通澳人的话，全澳肯定炸锅了，但目前就一篇报道而已。唯一的可能性就是那是澳洲公民其实是穆斯林难民女性，所以机场穆斯林工作人员才不放她们在眼里。  
  
所以，是穆斯林之间的侵犯。

你欺负我 我就欺负台湾  
  
这味道是不是很熟悉  
  
但是机场搜身的话不犯说吧 还是海关错把澳洲人看成法国人了 检查私密位置真的有必要吗 ……
