      Russia Charges Scientist With Passing Information to China

  
The case underscores delicate relations between Moscow and Beijing

Russia and China have touted their strengthening relationship, but a history of rivalry and mutual suspicion remains.  
MOSCOW—Russian prosecutors have charged a distinguished Russian scientist with treason after accusing him of passing classified information to China, according to his lawyer, in an example of the fragile friend-foe [relationship between Moscow and Beijing]( "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-china-vie-for-influence-in-central-asia-as-u-s-plans-afghan-exit-11560850203").  
  
Valery Mitko, president of the prestigious Arctic Civic Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg, was arrested in February on the grounds of “treason in the form of espionage,” his lawyer Ivan Pavlov said Monday.  
  
Mr. Pavlov said his client was accused of “transmitting information to do with hydro-acoustics.” He didn’t provide details on the specific nature of the material, but the official Russian news agency TASS cited a source familiar with the investigation as saying that Mr. Mitko gave China information related to “research on hydro-acoustics and submarine detection methods.”  
The St. Petersburg branch of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, that is investigating Mr. Mitko’s case, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. An email to China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs inquiring about the case and whether Chinese authorities were familiar with Mr. Mitko wasn’t answered.  
Mr. Mitko, 78, denies the charges and has been placed under house arrest until Oct. 10, Mr. Pavlov said.  
  
Mr. Pavlov is head of Team 29, an informal association of rights activists which said it got involved in the case this month. “We believe that publicity and public outcry give a chance for a fair hearing,” Mr. Pavlov said.  
He said that for the past several years Mr. Mitko traveled to China to give lectures on hydro-acoustics at the same university and his last trip was in 2018.  
The only documents he took with him were “scientific materials,” which he used for his teaching activities, Mr. Pavlov said. “There were no secret documents. He had some documents on hydro-acoustics, but all the documents were based only on open sources,” he said.  
Mr. Pavlov said Mr. Mitko never passed any documents to anyone and “especially not to representatives of Chinese special services, with whom he simply was not familiar,” he said. If a representative from Chinese special services was ever in his surroundings, “he did not know this,” Mr. Pavlov said.  
In recent years, [Russia and China]( "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-and-russia-are-partnersand-now-have-a-55-billion-pipeline-to-prove-it-11575225030") have touted their strengthening relationship in the sphere of trade and technology and through [military ties]( "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-promises-further-military-cooperation-with-russia-11563973937"). But a history of rivalry and mutual suspicion remains between the two nations as they both seek to expand their economic and strategic influence on the world stage.  
In recent years, China has rapidly expanded its undersea fleet and succeeded in its quest to join the elite club of countries with nuclear submarines that can ply the high seas. Beijing’s increasingly potent and active sub force represents China’s most significant military challenge yet for the region and its enhanced underwater capabilities heighten the country’s capacity to enforce its territorial claims and thwart U.S. intervention.  
The Pentagon’s 2019 annual report to Congress on the Chinese military said that “civilian research could support a strengthened Chinese military presence in the Arctic Ocean, which could include deploying submarines to the region as a deterrent against nuclear attacks.”  
According to biographical information published by Roscongress, a socially oriented development institution that organizes forums and international conventions, Mr. Mitko is a reserve Captain 1st Rank, the most senior rank in the staff officer’s career group in the Russian Navy. From 1963 to 1994, he was a crew member on ships and submarines and an employee of naval institutes. Since 1994, when he was transferred to reserve as head of the Naval Academy’s department of undersea information systems, he has continued his scientific and pedagogical activity in academic and educational establishments, according to Roscongress.  
According to TASS, throughout the course of his career, Mr. Mitko was awarded two dozen prestigious medals for scientific achievements. He has authored and co-authored more than 400 scientific papers and two textbooks.  
Mr. Pavlov said he believes his client was arrested on espionage charges because “he’s in a risk group, which includes scientists who are carriers of extremely sensitive information, where criteria are blurred, and who have international contacts,” he said.  
At least eight Russian scientists have been arrested and charged with treason in recent years for allegedly disclosing state secrets to foreigners, in high-profile criminal cases, according to TASS.  
The list includes Vladimir Lapygin, a former space researcher at the Russian space agency, Roskosmos, who was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2016 after being convicted of passing classified material to China. Mr. Lapygin, 79, maintained his innocence. Memorial, a human rights group based in Moscow, categorized Mr. Lapygin as a political prisoner and had called for his immediate release. On June 11, a Moscow court freed him on parole.  
The investigation into Mr. Mitko’s case is still ongoing, Mr. Pavlov said. If the case goes to trial and the scientist is convicted, he could serve up to 20 years in prison, the lawyer said.

我認為這是一個好的開始。普丁在教育他兒子的問題上應該更嚴厲一些，而且應該時時刻刻管住。他兒子太無法無天了。他兒子幾年前就向全世界一輸出革命，二輸出飢餓和貧困，三還要折騰世界各國人民。現在他兒子竟然偷爹的東西，這不治一治能行嗎？  
  
我認為普丁可以把他兒子的玩具沒收，比如說99式、蘇凱-27這些，免得他兒子趁他不在身邊時霸凌武力弱小的人。還有他兒子手下那些以「黑社會老大」的形式捧他兒子的狐朋狗友，普丁可以把牠們收拾掉。嚴父就是應該確保兒子身邊的人都是聽他父親話的人。以後他兒子要玩具，可以從他那裡借，但是管理玩具的必須是普丁自己的人。  
  
如果普丁能夠把兒子及其狐朋狗友的黑幫整肅掉，換成普丁的「聯合艦隊」、使他的兒子（像他一樣）敬畏神明、善待他人，那麼我認為不僅他兒子小學的低年級同學能過上更有著落的生活，而且全世界都會少很多因為他兒子到處輸出垃圾和折騰人而造成的人禍。

普京：我想聯同美國打死中國，可是沒有好的藉口，大家來提點意見。  
某人：我們派個特務向中國收錢，交一點情報，然後指控他叛國，再順手滅了中國。  
普京：好主義。養的狗不聽話就要宰，是時候教訓一下不聽話的狗，叫他知道自己是狗不是龍。

俄國目前應該是在等美國的甜頭吧  
  
英國開始也是扭扭捏捏的，美國說5G我包了金毛二號立馬雄起  
  
巴西這兩日也是走英國的路，美國說5G我買單，華為馬上被踢  
  
接下來就看美國為俄國的轉向肯開出什麼優厚條件。俄國知道自己的立場有份量，不會為5G一類的東西就賣習，但最後還是價錢的問題。所以目前還在等金毛一號給個滿意的交易，僅此而已
