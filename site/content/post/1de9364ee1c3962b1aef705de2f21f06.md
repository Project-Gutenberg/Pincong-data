A whistleblower CEO and Biden insider, Tony Bobulinski, released a public statement on Wednesday evening backing up the reporting of the _New York Post_ from last week and claiming that he personally witnessed Democrat presidential nominee former Vice President Joe Biden discussing business deals with his son, Hunter Biden.  
  
... ...  
Bobulinski’s statement in full:  
  

> _My name is Tony Bobulinski. The facts set forth below are true and accurate; they are not any form of domestic or foreign disinformation.  Any suggestion to the contrary is false and offensive. I am the recipient of the email published seven days ago by the New York Post which showed a copy to Hunter Biden and Rob Walker. That email is genuine. _  
>   
> _This afternoon I received a request from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs and the Senate Committee on Finance requesting all documents relating to my business affairs with the Biden family as well as various foreign entities and individuals. I have extensive relevant records and communications and I intend to produce those items to both Committees in the immediate future. _  
>   
> _I am the grandson of a 37 year Army Intelligence officer, the son of a 20+ year career Naval Officer and the brother of a 28 year career Naval Flight Officer.  I myself served our country for 4 years and left the Navy as LT Bobulinski.  I held a high level security clearance and was an instructor and then CTO for Naval Nuclear Power Training Command.  I take great pride in the time my family and I served this country.  I am also not a political person. What few campaign contributions I have made in my life were to Democrats. _  
>   
> _If the media and big tech companies had done their jobs over the past several weeks I would be irrelevant in this story.  Given my long standing service and devotion to this great country, I could no longer allow my family’s name to be associated or tied to Russian disinformation or implied lies and false narratives dominating the media right now._  
>   
> _After leaving the military I became an institutional investor investing extensively around the world and on every continent. I have traveled to over 50 countries.  I believe, hands down, we live in the greatest country in the world._  
>   
> _What I am outlining is fact.  I know it is fact because I lived it.  I am the CEO of Sinohawk Holdings which was a partnership between the Chinese operating through CEFC/Chairman Ye and the Biden family.  I was brought into the company to be the CEO by James Gilliar and Hunter Biden.  The reference to “the Big Guy” in the much publicized May 13, 2017 email is in fact a reference to Joe Biden.  The other “JB” referenced in that email is Jim Biden, Joe’s brother._  
>   
> _Hunter Biden called his dad ‘the Big Guy’ or ‘my Chairman,’ and frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing. I’ve seen Vice President Biden saying he never talked to Hunter about his business. I’ve seen firsthand that that’s not true, because it wasn’t just Hunter’s business, they said they were putting the Biden family name and its legacy on the line._  
>   
> _I realized the Chinese were not really focused on a healthy financial ROI.  They were looking at this as a political or influence investment. Once I realized that Hunter wanted to use the company as his personal piggy bank by just taking money out of it as soon as it came from the Chinese, I took steps to prevent that from happening._  
>   
> _The Johnson Report connected some dots in a way that shocked me — it made me realize the Bidens had gone behind my back and gotten paid millions of dollars by the Chinese, even though they told me they hadn’t and wouldn’t do that to their partners._  
>   
> _I would ask the Biden family to address the American people and outline the facts so I can go back to being irrelevant — and so I am not put in a position to have to answer those questions for them. _  
>   
> _I don’t have a political ax to grind; I just saw behind the Biden curtain and I grew concerned with what I saw. The Biden family aggressively leveraged the Biden family name to make millions of dollars from foreign entities even though some were from communist controlled China._  
>   
> _God Bless America!!!!_

此人Tony Bobulinski 的如上公开声明是在他接到美国参议院国家安全委员会要求他交出与拜登家族生意往来文件后发表的，他在亨特拜登指挥下任职为中国华信能源CEFC与拜登合资公司的CEO，即上周爆料亨特拜登电脑email中的收件人，他在声明中指出拜登家族在合资公司中平分资产的The Big Guy就是指乔拜登，而另一个上周爆料时未知名字JB则是乔拜登的弟弟James Biden: 这真是个拜登犯罪家族啊！这样的贪腐卖国家族首领在竞选还遥遥领先美国总统大选，荒唐透顶啊！美国还有希望吗？

選不上就沒事了，參選就是政治豪賭，你過去所有的行為會被全國上下尤其是敵對陣營徹底挖開來檢視，當然當年拜登當副手時可能真的手眼通天，不過顆顆顆....川普可完全不管這些的，誰擋了他的道，川普就讓他無路可走

乔拜登这是滥用副总统职位换取海外金钱的渎职叛国行为，选不上也得继续追查并最终入狱，参院国安委员会的调查不会随大选结束而停止的
