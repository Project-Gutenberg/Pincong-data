拜登总统就职演说全文（中英双语）

（翻译：剑桥中国中心）

This is America's day. This is democracy's day. A day of history and hope of renewal and resolve through a crucible for the ages. America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge. Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. The people, the will of the people, has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded.

这是属于美国的日子。这是属于民主的日子。这是历史和希望的日子，复苏和决心的日子。美国经过长久以来严酷的考验，已经成为一个崭新的国家，能够直面挑战。今天，我们庆祝的不是一位候选人的胜利，而是一项事业的胜利，这是民主的事业。人民以及人民的意愿得到倾听和关注。

We've learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile and, at this hour my friends, democracy has prevailed. So now on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the Capitol's very foundations, we come together as one nation under God - indivisible - to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries.

我们再次意识到，民主的可贵和脆弱。朋友们，民主在此刻获胜。几天前，在这片神圣的土地上，暴力震动了国会大厦的基础。我们在上帝的佑护下全国团结，不可分裂，让这个两百多年历史的国家和平地完成权力交接。　　As we look ahead in our uniquely American way, restless, bold, optimistic, and set our sights on a nation we know we can be and must be, I thank my predecessors of both parties. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. And I know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength, the strength of our nation, as does President Carter, who I spoke with last night who cannot be with us today, but who we salute for his lifetime of service.　　当我们瞭望独特的美国之路：不安分、大胆、乐观，我们放眼成为一个应该成为的国家。我感谢所有两党的前任总统们。我对他们表示发自内心的感谢。正如前总统卡特一样，我深知我们宪法和国家的力量。他今天无法在场，我昨晚与他通话，我们向他一辈子对国家的鞠躬尽瘁致敬。　　I've just taken a sacred oath each of those patriots have taken. The oath first sworn by George Washington. But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us. On we the people who seek a more perfect union. This is a great nation, we are good people. And over the centuries through storm and strife in peace and in war we've come so far. But we still have far to go.　　我刚刚如诸位前辈那样神圣地宣誓。国父乔治·华盛顿是第一个说出这番誓言的人。然而美国的故事不依赖我们任何一个或一些人，而是我们所有人。它依赖于那些探索一个更完美的联邦政府的人。这是一个伟大的国家，我们是善良的人民。经过几百年的洗礼，经过风暴与冲突，和平与战争，我们走了这么远。但是我们还有很长的路要走。　　We'll press forward with speed and urgency for we have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibility. Much to do, much to heal, much to restore, much to build and much to gain. Few people in our nation's history have been more challenged or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now. A once in a century virus that silently stalks the country has taken as many lives in one year as in all of World War Two.　　我们带着速度和紧迫感前进，因为在这个险境重重的冬天我们有很多要完成的事情和重要的可能性。我们有很多要做的事业，很多需要愈合，很多需要恢复，很多需要建立，很多需要获得。在我们国家的历史上，几乎没有人面临比现在更具有挑战的时刻。百年一遇的病毒悄悄地潜入我们国家，在一年时间里带走的生命和二战中牺牲的人数一样多。　　Millions of jobs have been lost. Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed. A cry for racial justice, some 400 years in the making, moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. A cry for survival comes from the planet itself, a cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear now. The rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism, that we must confront and we will defeat.　　百万人失业，成千上万的生意关门。几百年来对种族平等的呼声推动了我们前进。公正的梦想不再推迟。地球发出了生存的呼喊，它的呐喊无比迫切清晰。我们要对抗政治极端主义、白人至上主义和境内恐怖主义，我们将战胜它们。　　To overcome these challenges, to restore the soul and secure the future of America, requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy - unity. Unity. In another January on New Year's Day in 1863 Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. When he put pen to paper the president said, and I quote, 'if my name ever goes down in history, it'll be for this act, and my whole soul is in it'.　　解决这些挑战，恢复人们的信念和确保美国的未来，需要的不仅仅是言语。这需要民主中最难以获得的团结。1863年的元旦，林肯总统签署了《解放黑人奴隶宣言》。签字结束后，他说“如果我可以留名历史，将是因为这项法案，我所有的灵魂都在其中”。　　Image　　My whole soul is in it today, on this January day. My whole soul is in this. Bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation. And I ask every American to join me in this cause. Uniting to fight the foes we face - anger, resentment and hatred. Extremism, lawlessness, violence, disease, joblessness, and hopelessness.　　我整个灵魂都在今日，在一月的今日。我整个灵魂都在这项事业中：把美国团结起来，让人民团结，让国家团结。我呼吁每个美国人都加入这项事业。团结起来与敌人战斗——愤怒怨恨、极端主义、无视法律、暴力、疾病、失业和无望。　　With unity we can do great things, important things. We can right wrongs, we can put people to work in good jobs, we can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome the deadly virus, we can rebuild work, we can rebuild the middle class and make work secure, we can secure racial justice and we can make America once again the leading force for good in the world.　　团结让我们成就伟大的事情。我们能纠正错误，让人民有好工作，我们能在安全的学校教学生。我们能战胜致命的病毒，创造工作机会，重建中产阶级和让工作更稳定，我们能实现种族公正，能让美国再次成为世界积极的领导力量。　　I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days. I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal, that we are all created equal, and the harsh ugly reality that racism, nativism and fear have torn us apart. The battle is perennial and victory is never secure.　　我明白，在当下谈论团结像是愚蠢的幻想。我明白分裂我们的力量深远真实。但是我也知道这种挣扎绝非新事物。我们的历史是美国理想不断斗争的过程。我们生来平等，种族主义、本土保护注意和恐惧这些丑陋残酷的现实将我们撕裂。斗争绵延不断，胜利从不绝对。　　Through civil war, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setback, our better angels have always prevailed. In each of our moments enough of us have come together to carry all of us forward and we can do that now. History, faith and reason show the way. The way of unity.　　经过南北战争、大萧条、世界大战、911，经过挣扎、牺牲和挫折，我们正义的天使一直占上风。在所有的时刻，有足够的我们团结一心向前走，我们现在也能做到。历史、信念和理性为我们指路，团结之路。　　We can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbours. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature. For without unity there is no peace, only bitterness and fury, no progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge. And unity is the path forward. And we must meet this moment as the United States of America.　　我们可以把彼此当做邻居而不是对手。我们能用尊严和尊敬对待彼此。我们能同心协力，停止喊叫，降低紧张气氛。没有团结就没有和平，没有团结就只剩苦涩和愤怒，没有进步，只有精疲力尽的暴行。那不是国家，只是混乱的状态。这是我们历史危机和挑战的时刻。团结是向前的路。我们必须以美国的身份团结。　　Image　　If we do that, I guarantee we will not failed. We have never, ever, ever, ever failed in America when we've acted together. And so today at this time in this place, let's start afresh, all of us. Let's begin to listen to one another again, hear one another, see one another. Show respect to one another. Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war and we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured. 　　如果我们能做到，我保证我们不会失败。只要我们团结，美国就永远永远不会失败。今天此刻此地，让我们所有人重新开始。让我们开始倾听彼此，看见彼此，尊重彼此。政治不需要是摧毁一切的怒火。意见不同不需要成为战争的引火索。我们必须抵制控制和伪造的文化。　　My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this. We have to be better than this and I believe America is so much better than this. Just look around. Here we stand in the shadow of the Capitol dome. As mentioned earlier, completed in the shadow of the Civil War. When the union itself was literally hanging in the balance. We endure, we prevail. Here we stand, looking out on the great Mall, where Dr King spoke of his dream.　　我的同胞们，我们需要比当下更多样。我们需要比当下更好。我相信美国一定能更好。看看四周，我们站在国会大厦穹顶的影子下。当联邦政府的地位岌岌可危，我们百折不挠，终将取胜。我们所站之处能看到马丁·路德·金演讲他的梦想的地方。　　Here we stand, where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote. And today we mark the swearing in of the first woman elected to national office, Vice President Kamala Harris. Don't tell me things can change. Here we stand where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace.　　108年前，我们所站之处，在另一场就职演说上，几千名抗议者试图阻止勇敢的女性为获得投票权而游行。今天我们见证了第一位女性副总统贺锦丽。不要告诉我事情会改变。如今我们站在英雄倾尽全力的安息之处。　　And here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen, it will never happen, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Not ever. To all those who supported our campaign, I'm humbled by the faith you placed in us. To all those who did not support us, let me say this. Hear us out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart.　　我们所站之处，几天前一群暴徒妄图用暴力熄灭人民的意愿，阻止民主的进程，试图将我们从这神圣之地赶走。暴徒的愿望没有实现，今天和明天不会实现，永远不会实现。对支持我们竞选的人们，我们感激你们对我们的信念。对没有支持我们的人，请关注我们前进的步伐，监督我和我的心。　　Image　　If you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America. The right to dissent peacefully. And the guardrail of our democracy is perhaps our nation's greatest strength. If you hear me clearly, disagreement must not lead to disunion. And I pledge this to you. I will be a President for all Americans, all Americans. And I promise you I will fight for those who did not support me as for those who did.　　如果你依然有异议，那也只能接受。这是民主。这是美国。这是和平表达不同意见的权利。民主的护栏也许是我们国家最重要的优点。意见不同不一定要导致分裂。我向你们保证。我将会是所有美国人的总统，所有的美国人。我承诺，我会捍卫支持我和不支持我的人的权利。　　Many centuries ago, St Augustine - the saint of my church - wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love. Defined by the common objects of their love. What are the common objects we as Americans love, that define us as Americans? I think we know. Opportunity, security, liberty, dignity, respect, honour, and yes, the truth.　　几百年前，圣奥古斯丁——也是我教堂的圣人——写道“人被他们所爱之物定义”。什么是美国人所爱之物，什么定义了美国人？我觉得我们知道。机遇、安全、自由、尊严、尊重、荣誉和真理。　　Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth and there are lies. Lies told for power and for profit. And each of us has a duty and a responsibility as citizens as Americans and especially as leaders. Leaders who are pledged to honour our Constitution to protect our nation. To defend the truth and defeat the lies.　　近几周和几个月给我们上了痛苦的一课。有真理有谎言。人们为了权利和利益说谎。我们每个人作为美国公民，尤其是领导们都有责任。领导有责任遵守宪法保护我们的国家，捍卫真理戳穿谎言。　　Look, I understand that many of my fellow Americans view the future with fear and trepidation. I understand they worry about their jobs. I understand like their dad they lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling thinking: 'Can I keep my healthcare? Can I pay my mortgage?' Thinking about their families, about what comes next. I promise you, I get it. But the answer's not to turn inward. To retreat into competing factions. Distrusting those who don't look like you, or worship the way you do, who don't get their news from the same source as you do.　　我理解很多美国人带着恐惧和忧虑看待未来。我理解他们担心他们的工作。我理解，他们的父亲晚上躺在床上盯着天花板想：“我能保住我的医疗保险吗？我能还得起房贷吗？”他们考虑着家人，思索着接下来会怎么样。我保证，我理解这种感受。然而答案不在内心煎熬，不是内部斗争，不是不相信与你容貌、信仰或是认知不同的人。　　We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts, if we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes, as my mom would say. Just for a moment, stand in their shoes.　　我们必须停止这场内部斗争，停止城市和乡村，保守和自由间的斗争。如果我们敞开心扉而不是铁石心肠，如果我们表现出宽容和谦卑，如果我们愿意站在别人立场看问题，那么我们就能做到。　　Because here's the thing about life. There's no accounting for what fate will deal you. Some days you need a hand. There are other days when we're called to lend a hand. That's how it has to be, that's what we do for one another. And if we are that way our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future. And we can still disagree.　　因为这是生活。你不知道命运如何。有时你需要援助之手，有时候你可以伸出援助之手。这是应有的样子，这是我们应该互相照料彼此的样子。如果我们能这样，国家会更强大，更繁荣，对未来更有准备。同时，我们依然能有不同意见。　　My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us we're going to need each other. We need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter. We're entering what may be the darkest and deadliest period of the virus. We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation, one nation. And I promise this, as the Bible says, 'Weeping may endure for a night, joy cometh in the morning'. We will get through this together. Together.　　我的同胞们，前方的事业决定了我们需要彼此。我们需要所有的力量来度过寒冬。我们处在病毒最黑暗和最致命的阶段。我们必须把政治放在一边，以一个国家的姿态面对疫情。我保证，正如《圣经》中所说：“一宿虽然有哭泣，早晨便必欢呼”。我们将一起度过，携手同行。　　Look folks, all my colleagues I serve with in the House and the Senate up here, we all understand the world is watching. Watching all of us today. So here's my message to those beyond our borders. America has been tested and we've come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances, and engage with the world once again. Not to meet yesterday's challenges but today's and tomorrow's challenges. And we'll lead not merely by the example of our power but the power of our example.　　我在白宫和议院共事的同事们都在此，我们都知道世界在看着我们。看着我们今天的表现。这是我给世界的信息。美国经历了挑战，我们变得更加坚强。我们将修复盟友关系，再次与世界对话。不仅面对昨天的挑战，还有今天和明天的挑战。我们将以实力做榜样。　　Fellow Americans, moms, dads, sons, daughters, friends, neighbours and co-workers. We will honour them by becoming the people and the nation we can and should be. So I ask you let's say a silent prayer for those who lost their lives, those left behind and for our country. Amen.　　美国同胞们、母亲们、父亲们、儿子们、女儿们、朋友们、邻居们和同事们，我们将成为应该成为的人民和国家，用这种方式来致敬所有人。让我们为那些为国家献出生命的人们默默祷告。阿门。　　Folks, it's a time of testing. We face an attack on our democracy, and on truth, a raging virus, a stinging inequity, systemic racism, a climate in crisis, America's role in the world. Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. But the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with one of the greatest responsibilities we've had. Now we're going to be tested. Are we going to step up?　　同胞们，这是经历考验的时候。我们面临着对我们民主和真理的打击，我们面对着肆虐的疫情、让人痛心的不公平、系统性的种族歧视、气候危机和美国在世界的角色。其中任何一项足够带来严峻的挑战。然而我们同时面对所有挑战，向整个国家展现出巨大的责任感。如今我们经历着考验。我们能迎难而上吗？　　It's time for boldness for there is so much to do. And this is certain, I promise you. We will be judged, you and I, by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era. We will rise to the occasion. Will we master this rare and difficult hour? Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world to our children? I believe we must and I'm sure you do as well. I believe we will, and when we do, we'll write the next great chapter in the history of the United States of America. The American story.　　这是需要勇气的时候，因为我们需要做的实在是太多了。我可以确定，我们会被评判，你和我，会因解决时代危机的表现而受评判。我们会迎难而上。我们能掌控这艰难且罕见的时机吗？我们会履行责任，将一个更好的新世界交给我们的孩子吗？我相信我们必须能，我相信你也是这么想的。我相信我们做得到。当我们做到的时候，我们将书写美国历史的新篇章。美国的故事。　　A story that might sound like a song that means a lot to me, it's called American Anthem. And there's one verse that stands out at least for me and it goes like this: 'The work and prayers of century have brought us to this day, which shall be our legacy, what will our children say? Let me know in my heart when my days are through, America, America, I gave my best to you.'　　有个叫《美国国歌》的故事对我有重要的意义，这个故事的名字像是一首歌。其中有一段是这样的“百年的劳作和祷告把我带到今日，这是我们的遗产，我们的孩子们会怎么说？当我时日将近，我问心无愧，美国美国，我把最好的给了你。”　　Image　　Let us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our great nation. If we do this, then when our days are through, our children and our children's children will say of us: 'They gave their best, they did their duty, they healed a broken land.'　　让我们把努力和祷告带入美国的故事中。如果我们做得到，我们的日子就有盼头，我们的孩子和他们的孩子会这样评价我们：“他们竭尽所能，履行了责任，他们治愈了破碎的国家。”　　My fellow Americans I close the day where I began, with a sacred oath. Before God and all of you, I give you my word. I will always level with you. I will defend the Constitution, I'll defend our democracy. I'll defend America and I will give all - all of you - keep everything I do in your service. Thinking not of power but of possibilities. Not of personal interest but of public good.　　我的同胞们，让我以开场时宣誓的方式结束就职演说。在上帝和人民面前，我宣誓：我将永远与你一样平等；我将捍卫宪法，捍卫民主，捍卫美国；我给你们，你们所有人，让我做的一切是为了服务你们。我所想的不是权力而是可能性，不为个人利益而为公共谋利。　　And together we will write an American story of hope, not fear. Of unity not division, of light not darkness. A story of decency and dignity, love and healing, greatness and goodness. May this be the story that guides us. The story that inspires us. And the story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history, we met the moment. Democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch but thrive.　　我们将一起谱写美国的故事，是希望而不是恐惧的故事，是团结而不是分裂的故事，是光明而不是黑暗的故事。尊严、爱、治愈、伟大和美好的故事，希望这是引导我们的故事，启发我们的故事。让未来知道这是我们面对历史呼唤的故事。我们相遇在此刻。民主和希望，真理和正义，在我们这里没有消亡，而是愈加繁盛。　　That America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world. That is what we owe our forbearers, one another, and generations to follow.　　美国保证了国家的自由，再一次以灯塔的姿态立于全世界。这是我们需要向前辈交待的，向后代交待的。　　So with purpose and resolve, we turn to those tasks of our time. Sustained by faith, driven by conviction and devoted to one another and the country we love with all our hearts. May God bless America and God protect our troops.　　带着使命感和决心，我们面对时代的任务。通过信念的支持，被坚信驱动，全心全意为国家奉献。上帝保佑美国，上帝保佑我们的军队。　　Thank you, America.　　感谢你，美国。
