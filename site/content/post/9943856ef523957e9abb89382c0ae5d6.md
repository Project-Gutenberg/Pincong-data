歌词  
  
Turn around to see you  
In a crowded place  
I watch for the emotions  
On a guarded face  
Saying lead me on  
Victim of a dream  
And a memory  
But when I try to break free  
You say to me  
C'mon lead me on  
A matter out of time  
In the reaches of space  
Caught up in the patterns  
In the light of a life  
Walk across the bridge  
To the shadows of the night  
Saying lead me on  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
On and on  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
On and on  
Lead me on  
Voices in the night  
Chase the demons away  
Looking in the mirror  
It's easy to say  
C'mon lead me on  
The choices of a lifetime  
In the dreams of a day  
When the coast is gettin' clearer  
I hear you say  
C'mon lead me on  
A matter out of time  
In the look on your face  
Caught up in the patterns  
In the light of a life  
Walk across the bridge  
To the shadows of the night  
Saying lead me on  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
On and on  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
On and on  
Lead me on  
Talk to me of lightning  
I'll hear what you say, my love  
Reaching for the meaning all of the way  
I can't keep believing in you and me, my love  
Finding the answers that we need  
Sometimes it's meant to be  
Lead me on, lead me on  
Turn around to see you  
In a crowded place  
I watch for the emotions  
As they cross your face  
Saying lead me on  
I see you in a dream  
And a memory  
A captive of the light  
You say to me  
C'mon and lead me on  
Lead me on  
C'mon and lead me on  
On, on and on  
C'mon and lead me on  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
On, on and on  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
On, on and on  
C'mon and lead me on  
Lead me on  
Lead me on

好听，忽然觉得有一种日本动画主题曲的热血感😂  
不过当时我并没有太注意这一首，那时候完全沉浸在Take My Breath Away里了
