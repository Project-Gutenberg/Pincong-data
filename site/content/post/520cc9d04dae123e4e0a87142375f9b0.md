和土共认不认没什么关系，其它国家认就可以了。

真正的英雄科學家合理推斷沒幾個人看，郭系“英雄科學家”微信截圖當爆料動不動被無腦狂轉，哎

這麼長的文章，有沒有人能總結一下？  
  
稍微看了一下，重點好像是看不到病毒的早期變異，有可能已經在實驗室完成。而且病毒的變異可能是在誘導下完成。  
  
  
In the coming weeks, as the spring sun chased shadows across her kitchen floor, Chan stood at her counter and pounded out her paper, barely pausing to eat or sleep. **It was clear that the first SARS evolved rapidly during its first three months of existence, constantly fine-tuning its ability to infect humans, and settling down only during the later stages of the epidemic. In contrast, the new virus looked a lot more like late-stage SARS. “It’s almost as if we’re missing the early phase,” Chan marveled to Zhan. Or, as she put it in their paper, as if “it was already well adapted for human transmission.”**  
  
That was a profoundly provocative line. Chan was implying that the virus was already familiar with human physiology when it had its coming-out party in Wuhan in late 2019. If so, there were three possible explanations.  
  
Perhaps it was just staggeringly bad luck: The mutations had all occurred in an earlier host species, and just happened to be the perfect genetic arrangement for an invasion of humanity. But that made no sense. Those mutations would have been disadvantageous in the old host.  
  
Maybe the virus had been circulating undetected in humans for months, working out the kinks, and nobody had noticed. Also unlikely. China’s health officials would not have missed it, and even if they had, they’d be able to go back now through stored samples to find the trail of earlier versions. And they weren’t coming up with anything.  
  
That left a third possibility: **The missing phase had happened in a lab, where the virus had been trained on human cells.** Chan knew this was the third rail of potential explanations. At the time, conspiracy theorists were spinning bioweapon fantasies, and Chan was loath to give them any ammunition. But she also didn’t want to play politics by withholding her findings. Chan is in her early thirties, still at the start of her career, and an absolute idealist about the purity of the scientific process. Facts were facts.

完了，目测要被消失  
  
建议这段时间还是先跑进中立国大使馆躲一阵子吧

没有直接的证据，共匪不会认的。

这种质疑除了口嗨一下没啥意义，除了实验室的原始实验记录，或者自然界原始宿主，没有任何证据能证明这个病毒是人造的还是野生的，凡是看到说分析了这个东西的序列就怎么怎么知道它是哪来的基本都是胡扯。

军方病毒，去年默克尔来武汉同济医院推中德生物合作，被德方教授带出样本反被投毒  
  
高层被几个犹太人带风向忽悠成美军投毒，还打电话问德国怎么办，做实了全球投毒和延误瞒报，这边德国早就整理好资料交给北约，中国被忽悠成傻逼  
  
然后一堆如郭文贵王立军李克强这样的中国妖孽为了内斗还在拼命往自身身上扣屎盆子竖中指  
  
克强不死 鲁难未已  
  
一帮公知贱儒要么疯狂碰瓷要么消极怠工宫斗使小绊子制造诸如内蒙教材之类的破事给皇上添堵泼粪，为清军入关后继续做官做准备，不知道自己卖了几年前的国只会让自己越来越下贱成为入关蒙古人眼中连妓女都不如的货色。  
  
  
恶臭你支

各自选一款阴谋论，忽悠忽悠你们这些不同立场的外行罢了，没啥本质区别。
