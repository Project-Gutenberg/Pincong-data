Christopher Robin, what exactly is doing nothing?  
Well, I'm told it means: going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not bothering.  
Dum-dedum, dee, dum dum.  
Dum-dedum, dee, dum dum.  
When I'm with you, I'm with you.  
(Reversed audio).  
Dum-dedum, dee, dum dum.  
Dum-dedum, dee, dum dum.  
When I'm with you, I'm with you.  
Forever, and ever.  
All alone. Ah come out moon.  
And you will always answer.  
Forever, forever. Forever, and ever.  
All alone. Ah come out moon.  
Listening to all the things you can't hear.  
No matter what. I te—always be togeth(er).  
You should know, always be to(gether).  
No matter what. I te—always be togeth(er).  
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-always be to(gether).  
No matter what. I te—always be togeth(er).  
You should know, always be to(gether).  
No matter what. I te—always be togeth(er).  
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.  
Every star, ah.  
Ever, ah.  
(Wher)ever you, ever.  
Every star, ah.  
And you will always answer.  
Every star, ah.  
Ever, ah.  
Wherever you, ever.  
Every star, ah.  
Find me.  
Oh.  
Are you there?  
Dum-dedum, dee, dum dum.  
Dum-dedum, dee, dum dum.  
When I'm with you, I'm with you.  
(Longer reversed audio).  
Dum-dedum, dee, dum dum.  
Dum-dedum, dee, dum dum.  
When I'm with you, I'm with you.  
Remember.  
Forever, and ever.  
All alone. Ah come out moon.  
And you will always answer.  
Forever, forever. Forever, and ever.  
All alone. Ah come out moon.  
I wanna stay like this.  
No matter what. I te—always be togeth(er).  
Ooh, you should know. Always be to(gether).  
No matter what. I te—always be togeth(er).  
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-always be to(gether).  
No matter what. I te—always be togeth(er).  
Ooh, you should know. Always be to(gether).  
No matter what. I te—always be togeth(er).  
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-always be togeth(er).  
Every star, ah.  
Ever, ah.  
(Wher)ever you, ever.  
Every star, ah.  
And you will always answer.  
Every star, ah.  
Ever, ah.  
Wherever you, ever.  
Every star, ah.  
Find me.  
No matter what. I te—always be togeth(er).  
Ooh, you should know. Always be to(gether).  
No matter what. I te—always be togeth(er).  
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-always be to(gether).  
No matter what. I te—always be togeth(er).  
Ooh, you should know. Always be to(gether).  
No matter what. I te—always be togeth(er).  
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-always be togeth(er).  
Ah. Oh.  
Are you... anywhere?
