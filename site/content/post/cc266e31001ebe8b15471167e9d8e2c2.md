_Mr. Speaker, all the members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, I am addressing all the people of the United Kingdom and all the people from the country with a big history._

_议长先生，全体议员，女士们先生们，我正在向联合王国全体人民讲话，向这个拥有伟大历史的国家的所有人讲话。_

_I am addressing you as a citizen, as a president of also a big country with the dream and big effort. I would like to tell you about the 13 days of war. The war that we didn’t start and we didn’t want it. Well, we have to conduct this war._

_我讲话的身份是公民，也是一个同样伟大的国家的总统，我们有自己的梦想，并且为之付诸巨大努力。我会告诉你们战争爆发十三天以来的情况。这是一场不由我们开启、也非我们所愿的战争。即便如此，我们必须正面迎战。  
_

_We do not want to lose what we have, what is ours - our country Ukraine - just the same way as you once didn’t want to lose your country when Nazis started to fight your country and you had to fight for Britain. _

_我们不想丢掉我们已有的东西，属于我们的东西——我们的国家，乌克兰——就像你们曾经做过的一样。纳粹开始轰炸你们国家的时候，你们也不想丢掉自己的国家，你们必须要为不列颠而战。  
_

__13 days of this struggle. On day one at 4:00 in the morning, we were attacked by cruise missiles. Everybody woke up.__

_这是十三天迄无宁日的激战。第一天早上凌晨四点，我们遭遇巡航导弹的袭击，所有人都被炸醒了。_

_People, children, the entire of Ukraine. And since that, we have not been sleeping. We have all been fighting for our country with our army. On day two, we have been fighting air strikes and our heroic military servicemen on the the islands have been trying to fight when Russian forces demanded that we lay down the arms._

_地无分南北，人无分老幼，整个乌克兰都在遇袭。从那一天起，我们就没有安眠过。我们的军队一直在为国家而战。第二天我们遭遇了空袭，英勇的军人在离岛上坚持作战，即便俄国人要求他们放下武器投降。_

__However, we needed to continue fighting and we did. We did feel our force, the force of our people that oppose the occupants and until the end. The next day, the artillery started fighting us. Our army showed us who we are and we have been able to see who our people and who are best known.__

_我们还需要继续战斗，我们也在坚持战斗。我们感受到了自身的力量，那是我们的人民战至最后一人也要抵抗占领者的力量。第二天，敌人开始向我们倾泻火力。我们的军队向世人展示了我们是谁，我们也成功地看到了我们的人民是谁，他们最惊艳绝人的品质又是什么。_

_On day four we started taking people captive, we have not been torturing them._  

_第四天我们开始擒获战俘，我们从未折磨过他们。  
_

_W_e remained humane even on day four of this terrible war. On day five, the terror against us was going on against children, against the cities and constant shellings have been taking place around the country, including hospitals. And that didn’t break us, that gave us a feeling of truth. On day six, the Russian rockets fell on Babyn Yar.__

_一直到第四天为止，这场可怕的战争还算保持在了人道的轨迹之内。但在第五天，对准我们的恐惧开始降临到儿童身上，倾泻到城市上方。经久不息的炮火在全国范围内四处延烧，甚至包括了医院。但是恐怖并没能击溃我们，只是让我们认识了真相。在第六天，俄国人的火箭弹落到了娘子谷。_

_That is the place where the Nazis killed thousands of people during the Second World War. And 80 years after the Russians hit at them for the second time, and even churches are getting destroyed by shelling._

_这就是二战期间的纳粹德国杀死数千人的地方。八十年过去了，俄国人在这里再次发动屠杀，甚至教堂都被炮火掀翻了。  
_

__On day eight, we have seen Russian tanks hitting the atomic power station and everybody has got to understand that this is a terror against everyone.__

_第八天，我们看到俄国人的坦克冲向了核电站，所有人都明白这是对所有人施加的恐怖。_

___On day nine, there was a meeting of NATO’s conference without the result that we were looking for. Yes, we did feel that we did feel that. We did feel , unfortunately, that the alliances don’t work properly all the time and the no fly zone cannot be enforced. And on day ten, the Ukrainians started protesting and was stopping the armored vehicles with their own hands.___

_在第九天，北约召开的会议却没能给出我们热望的结果。是的，这就是我们的所思所想。不幸的是，盟军一直以来并未照拂我们的感受，禁飞区也没有设立。第十天，乌克兰人开始抗击，他们用双手阻挡装甲洪流。_

____And on day 11, the children and cities were being hit and hospitals as well with the rockets and constant shelling and on that day we realised that Ukrainians became heroes. Entire cities - children and adults. And on day 12, the losses of a Russian army exceeded 10,000 people killed, including the general. That gave us hope that that there will be some kind of responsibility for those people of in front of the court.____  

_第十一天，儿童、城市、医院都挨了火箭弹，遭遇炮火的不停蹂躏。也正是在这一天，我们意识到乌克兰人已经是个英雄民族。乌克兰的所有城市都是英雄城市，儿童成人都是国家英雄。第十二天，俄国军队的阵亡人数已经超过一万人，包括将军级别的人。我们备受鼓舞，希望将那些发动战争的人推上被告席绳之以法。_

_____On day 13 in the city of Mariupol that was attacked by the Russian forces, a child was killed. They do not allow any food and water and people started panicking. I think everybody can hear that people do not have water over there._____

_第十三天，马里乌波尔再次遭遇俄军袭击，一名儿童被杀害。俄国人不同意为已经恐慌的人们提供饮食。我觉得，所有人都可以听到市民们的倾诉，他们缺乏饮水。_

______Over 13 days of this situation, over 50 children have been killed. These are the children that could have left. But these people have taken them away from us.______

______战争进行了十三天，超过五十名儿童已经死于战火。他们是本可以离开战场的儿童，但是入侵者从我们的手中夺走了他们的生命。  
______

_They do not condone Ukraine. We’re not looking to have this for the Ukraine, have not been looking to become big, but they have become big over the days of this war. We are the countries that are saving people despite having to fight the one of the biggest countries, one of the biggest armies in the world._

_俄国人并不宽待乌克兰，我们也不希求他们的宽待。我们从来不想耀武扬威，但他们发动战争的这些天来一直在明火执仗。我们是个希望拯救人民的国家，尽管我们仍要与世界最强大之一的国家作战，他们拥有世界上最称庞大的军队之一。_

_We have to fight the helicopters, rockets. The question for us now is to be or not to be. This is Shakespearean question. For 15 days, this question could have been asked. But now I can give you a definitive answer. It’s definitely yes, to be. And I would like to remind you the words that the United Kingdom have already heard, which are important again - we will not give up and we will not lose._

_我们必须与直升机作战，与火箭弹过招。我们现在的问题是：生存，还是毁灭？这是个莎士比亚的问题。仅仅在十五天以前，这都还不是个问题。但是现在，议员们，我可以给你们一个肯定的答案：我们当然要，生存。我愿意重新提起曾经响彻联合王国的那些句子，现在这些句子再次至关重要——我们永不放弃，我们永不言败。_

__We will fight till the end at sea. In the air. We will continue fighting for our land whatever the cost. We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets.__

__我们会在黑海之角作战，我们会在空中作战，我们会继续为国土而战，不管付出何种代价。我们会在森林中作战，我们会在平原上作战，我们会在海滩上作战，我们会在街巷里作战。  
__

___I would like to add that we will fight on the on the banks of different rivers like Nepal.___

_我还要补充一句，我们会在第聂伯河的左右河岸作战，我们会在第聂伯河大小支流的河滩作战。_

____We are looking for your help, for the help of the civilized countries. We are thankful for this help and I’m very grateful to you, Boris.____

_我们正在恳请你们的帮助，恳请对文明国家的帮助。我们对此衷心感激，极表谢忱。我本人更是非常感谢你，鲍里斯首相。_

_____Please increase the pressure of sanctions against this country. And please recognise this country as a terrorist state. Please make sure that our Ukrainian skies are safe. Please make sure that you do what needs to be done and what is stipulated by the greatness of your country._____

_____恳请你们加大对俄国的各项制裁力度，恳请你们认定这是个恐怖主义国家，恳请你们确保我们乌克兰的领空是安全的，恳请你们做出一切亟需去做的事情，这些都是贵国之所以伟大的题中之义。  
_____

______Best of all, to Ukraine and to the United Kingdom.______

_我祝大家一切顺利，祝福乌克兰，祝福联合王国。_
