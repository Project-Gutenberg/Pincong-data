对甘肃农业大学动物医学院魏彦明等人基金申请学术不端的举报

国家自然科学基金委：

甘肃农业大学动物医学院魏彦明 纪鹏 华永丽等人在国自然基金申请文章发表中多次一图两用，两篇文章共享完全相同的图片，被pubpeer 曝光，但仍然坚持惯用技俩，多次如法炮制，多次骗取国家自然科学基金，现将详情曝光如下，请基金委查处！

Characterization and antioxidative activities of polysaccharide in Chinese angelica and its processed productsInternational journal of biological macromolecules (2014) - 5 Commentsdoi: 10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.03.025  issn: 0141-8130  pubmed: 24680904  issn: 1879-0003 Peng Ji author has email , Yanming Wei author has email , Wenxin Xue author has email , Yongli Hua author has email , Man Zhang author has email , Hongguo Sun author has email , Zhixue Song author has email , Ling Zhang author has email , Jinxia Li author has email , Haifu Zhao author has email , Wenquan Zhang author has emailInstitute of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Gansu Agricult...#1 Elisabeth M Bik commented 9 months agoThe panels in Figure 3 of this paper look very similar to the panels in Figure 1 in another paper by the same research group. Some of the panels might represent treatment of mice with the same concoction of "Chinese angelica", but other panels appear to represent different treatments.

That other paper is Yongli Hua et al., Journal of Ethnopharmacology 151 (2014) 1090–1099, DOI: 10.1016/j.jep.2013.12.011 - see https://pubpeer.com/publications/4A43AE18FAC805965DDC3A8895130D. The Hua et al. paper was accepted on December 6, 2013, while this Ji et al. paper was submitted on December 19, 2013, so after acceptance of the Hua paper.

From the description of the mouse experiments in both papers it seems that these were different experiments. Hua paper: Mice kept at 25 degrees C, 40% relative humidity, 6 groups of 10 mice each. Ji paper: Mice kept at 22 degrees C, 50% relative humidity, 7 groups of 7 mice each.

Could the authors comment on the following concerns, please?

If two different sets of mice were used, how can the liver photos of the model and control group look so identical?How can the liver sections of mice treated with differently prepared Chinese angelica look so similar? For example, the liver marked in yellow represents the mouse treated with the soil preparation in the Ji paper, but also the charred preparation in the Hua paper. Similarly, the aqua live represents unprocessed preparation in the Ji paper and soil prep in the Hua paper.Did the authors consider any issues with copyright and/or lack of novelty by publishing the same study or photos twice?
