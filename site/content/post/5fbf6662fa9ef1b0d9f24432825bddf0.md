\[url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-preventing-online-censorship/\]\[/url\]  
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:  
  
Section 1.  Policy.Free speech is the bedrock of American democracy.  Our Founding Fathers protected this sacred right with the First Amendment to the Constitution.  The freedom to express and debate ideas is the foundation for all of our rights as a free people.  
  
In a country that has long cherished the freedom of expression, we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to hand pick the speech that Americans may access and convey on the internet.  This practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic.  When large, powerful social media companies censor opinions with which they disagree, they exercise a dangerous power.  They cease functioning as passive bulletin boards, and ought to be viewed and treated as content creators.  
  
The growth of online platforms in recent years raises important questions about applying the ideals of the First Amendment to modern communications technology.  Today, many Americans follow the news, stay in touch with friends and family, and share their views on current events through social media and other online platforms.  As a result, these platforms function in many ways as a 21st century equivalent of the public square.  
  
Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see.  
  
As President, I have made clear my commitment to free and open debate on the internet. Such debate is just as important online as it is in our universities, our town halls, and our homes.  It is essential to sustaining our democracy.  
  
Online platforms are engaging in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse.  Tens of thousands of Americans have reported, among other troubling behaviors, online platforms “flagging” content as inappropriate, even though it does not violate any stated terms of service; making unannounced and unexplained changes to company policies that have the effect of disfavoring certain viewpoints; and deleting content and entire accounts with no warning, no rationale, and no recourse.  
  
Twitter now selectively decides to place a warning label on certain tweets in a manner that clearly reflects political bias.  As has been reported, Twitter seems never to have placed such a label on another politician’s tweet.  As recently as last week, Representative Adam Schiff was continuing to mislead his followers by peddling the long-disproved Russian Collusion Hoax, and Twitter did not flag those tweets.  Unsurprisingly, its officer in charge of so-called ‘Site Integrity’ has flaunted his political bias in his own tweets.  
  
At the same time online platforms are invoking inconsistent, irrational, and groundless justifications to censor or otherwise restrict Americans’ speech here at home, several online platforms are profiting from and promoting the aggression and disinformation spread by foreign governments like China.  One United States company, for example, created a search engine for the Chinese Communist Party that would have blacklisted searches for “human rights,” hid data unfavorable to the Chinese Communist Party, and tracked users determined appropriate for surveillance.  It also established research partnerships in China that provide direct benefits to the Chinese military.  Other companies have accepted advertisements paid for by the Chinese government that spread false information about China’s mass imprisonment of religious minorities, thereby enabling these abuses of human rights.  They have also amplified China’s propaganda abroad, including by allowing Chinese government officials to use their platforms to spread misinformation regarding the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to undermine pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.  
  
As a Nation, we must foster and protect diverse viewpoints in today’s digital communications environment where all Americans can and should have a voice.  We must seek transparency and accountability from online platforms, and encourage standards and tools to protect and preserve the integrity and openness of American discourse and freedom of expression.  
  
Sec. 2.  Protections Against Online Censorship.  (a)  It is the policy of the United States to foster clear ground rules promoting free and open debate on the internet.  Prominent among the ground rules governing that debate is the immunity from liability created by section 230(c) of the Communications Decency Act (section 230(c)).  47 U.S.C. 230(c).  It is the policy of the United States that the scope of that immunity should be clarified: the immunity should not extend beyond its text and purpose to provide protection for those who purport to provide users a forum for free and open speech, but in reality use their power over a vital means of communication to engage in deceptive or pretextual actions stifling free and open debate by censoring certain viewpoints.  
  
Section 230(c) was designed to address early court decisions holding that, if an online platform restricted access to some content posted by others, it would thereby become a “publisher” of all the content posted on its site for purposes of torts such as defamation.  As the title of section 230(c) makes clear, the provision provides limited liability “protection” to a provider of an interactive computer service (such as an online platform) that engages in “‘Good Samaritan’ blocking” of harmful content.  In particular, the Congress sought to provide protections for online platforms that attempted to protect minors from harmful content and intended to ensure that such providers would not be discouraged from taking down harmful material.  The provision was also intended to further the express vision of the Congress that the internet is a “forum for a true diversity of political discourse.”  47 U.S.C. 230(a)(3).  The limited protections provided by the statute should be construed with these purposes in mind.  
  
In particular, subparagraph (c)(2) expressly addresses protections from “civil liability” and specifies that an interactive computer service provider may not be made liable “on account of” its decision in “good faith” to restrict access to content that it considers to be “obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable.”  It is the policy of the United States to ensure that, to the maximum extent permissible under the law, this provision is not distorted to provide liability protection for online platforms that — far from acting in “good faith” to remove objectionable content — instead engage in deceptive or pretextual actions (often contrary to their stated terms of service) to stifle viewpoints with which they disagree.  Section 230 was not intended to allow a handful of companies to grow into titans controlling vital avenues for our national discourse under the guise of promoting open forums for debate, and then to provide those behemoths blanket immunity when they use their power to censor content and silence viewpoints that they dislike.  When an interactive computer service provider removes or restricts access to content and its actions do not meet the criteria of subparagraph (c)(2)(A), it is engaged in editorial conduct.  It is the policy of the United States that such a provider should properly lose the limited liability shield of subparagraph (c)(2)(A) and be exposed to liability like any traditional editor and publisher that is not an online provider.  
  
(b)  To advance the policy described in subsection (a) of this section, all executive departments and agencies should ensure that their application of section 230(c) properly reflects the narrow purpose of the section and take all appropriate actions in this regard.  In addition, within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), in consultation with the Attorney General, and acting through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), shall file a petition for rulemaking with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requesting that the FCC expeditiously propose regulations to clarify:  
  
(i) the interaction between subparagraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of section 230, in particular to clarify and determine the circumstances under which a provider of an interactive computer service that restricts access to content in a manner not specifically protected by subparagraph (c)(2)(A) may also not be able to claim protection under subparagraph (c)(1), which merely states that a provider shall not be treated as a publisher or speaker for making third-party content available and does not address the provider’s responsibility for its own editorial decisions;  
  
(ii)  the conditions under which an action restricting access to or availability of material is not “taken in good faith” within the meaning of subparagraph (c)(2)(A) of section 230, particularly whether actions can be “taken in good faith” if they are:  
  
(A)  deceptive, pretextual, or inconsistent with a provider’s terms of service; or  
  
(B)  taken after failing to provide adequate notice, reasoned explanation, or a meaningful opportunity to be heard; and  
  
(iii)  any other proposed regulations that the NTIA concludes may be appropriate to advance the policy described in subsection (a) of this section.  
  
Sec. 3.  Protecting Federal Taxpayer Dollars from Financing Online Platforms That Restrict Free Speech.  (a)  The head of each executive department and agency (agency) shall review its agency’s Federal spending on advertising and marketing paid to online platforms.  Such review shall include the amount of money spent, the online platforms that receive Federal dollars, and the statutory authorities available to restrict their receipt of advertising dollars.  
  
(b)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall report its findings to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.  
  
(c)  The Department of Justice shall review the viewpoint-based speech restrictions imposed by each online platform identified in the report described in subsection (b) of this section and assess whether any online platforms are problematic vehicles for government speech due to viewpoint discrimination, deception to consumers, or other bad practices.  
  
Sec. 4.  Federal Review of Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices.  (a)  It is the policy of the United States that large online platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, as the critical means of promoting the free flow of speech and ideas today, should not restrict protected speech.  The Supreme Court has noted that social media sites, as the modern public square, “can provide perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard.”  _Packingham v. North Carolina_, 137 S. Ct. 1730, 1737 (2017).  Communication through these channels has become important for meaningful participation in American democracy, including to petition elected leaders.  These sites are providing an important forum to the public for others to engage in free expression and debate.  _Cf_. _PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins_, 447 U.S. 74, 85-89 (1980).  
  
(b)  In May of 2019, the White House launched a Tech Bias Reporting tool to allow Americans to report incidents of online censorship.  In just weeks, the White House received over 16,000 complaints of online platforms censoring or otherwise taking action against users based on their political viewpoints.  The White House will submit such complaints received to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  
  
(c)  The FTC shall consider taking action, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, pursuant to section 45 of title 15, United States Code.  Such unfair or deceptive acts or practice may include practices by entities covered by section 230 that restrict speech in ways that do not align with those entities’ public representations about those practices.  
  
(d)  For large online platforms that are vast arenas for public debate, including the social media platform Twitter, the FTC shall also, consistent with its legal authority, consider whether complaints allege violations of law that implicate the policies set forth in section 4(a) of this order.  The FTC shall consider developing a report describing such complaints and making the report publicly available, consistent with applicable law.  
  
Sec. 5.  State Review of Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices and Anti-Discrimination Laws.  (a)  The Attorney General shall establish a working group regarding the potential enforcement of State statutes that prohibit online platforms from engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices.  The working group shall also develop model legislation for consideration by legislatures in States where existing statutes do not protect Americans from such unfair and deceptive acts and practices. The working group shall invite State Attorneys General for discussion and consultation, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law.  
  
(b) Complaints described in section 4(b) of this order will be shared with the working group, consistent with applicable law. The working group shall also collect publicly available information regarding the following:  
  
(i) increased scrutiny of users based on the other users they choose to follow, or their interactions with other users;  
  
(ii) algorithms to suppress content or users based on indications of political alignment or viewpoint;  
  
(iii) differential policies allowing for otherwise impermissible behavior, when committed by accounts associated with the Chinese Communist Party or other anti-democratic associations or governments;  
  
(iv) reliance on third-party entities, including contractors, media organizations, and individuals, with indicia of bias to review content; and  
  
(v) acts that limit the ability of users with particular viewpoints to earn money on the platform compared with other users similarly situated.  
  
Sec. 6.  Legislation.  The Attorney General shall develop a proposal for Federal legislation that would be useful to promote the policy objectives of this order.  
  
Sec. 7.  Definition.  For purposes of this order, the term “online platform” means any website or application that allows users to create and share content or engage in social networking, or any general search engine.  
  
Sec. 8.  General Provisions. (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
  
(i)    the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or  
  
(ii)   the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.  
  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

這些所謂平台，全部受section 230條款保障。他們如果選擇認爲他們不是公衆平台，而是出版商即根據自己喜好選擇言論，那麼就不能躲在section 230條款裡受保護。

这就是个赞不赞成的事情。现在 Section 230 does not contain any requirements that moderation decisions be neutral.你们做这个只会给联邦政府更多管制言论的权力。谁来决定什么是“中立”，某个中央委员会么，民主党上台之后把这个的掌控权也掌握了的话你们要怎么办。现在最起码还有一个spectrum，全统一了之后你怎么保证结果是好的。另外这样的话4chan是不是要封了？因为是极右。品葱要是在美国品葱也给封了好不好，因为明显不是中立网站。

行政命令而已  
法律位階在最底層，實際執行方式和效力有待商榷。  
  
而且標題有誤導疑慮，這個命令無法阻止社群媒體審查言論，也並非以阻止作為目的。命令是要求社群媒體審查並標注後，必須負上審查責任。  
不能貼個標籤然後說跟自己無關

拜託你先看完整個行政命令，可以嗎？  
這個行政命令不是告訴你要封哪個網站，什麼言論是中立，是要分辨那些行爲那些準則可以受section 230保障。  
YouTube跟Twitter是可以繼續刪除它不喜歡的言論，刪除他不喜歡的用戶，只不過不能再躲在section230裡面而已。YouTube跟Twitter必須接受New York Post，CNN那樣的監管！  
現在言論被審查的明明就是普通民眾。YouTube因爲不想得罪中國，去年從反送中開始一直黃標談論事件的YouTuber。但說地球是平的那堆影片卻好好的。  
政治審查在YouTube，Facebook，Twitter特別嚴重。在美國偏向民主黨，在國際卻不敢得罪共產黨。玩雙重標準是不可能玩下去的，就這麼簡單。

对不起，私有企业就是可以这么干。Section 230里没有任何地方说明了审核机制必须是中立的。它的作用恰恰就是为了让platform可以自由地发布和删减内容而不受责任。  
这是section 230作者之一Ron Wyden说的：  
  
Section 230 is not about neutrality. Period. Full stop. 230 is all about letting private companies make their own decisions to leave up some content and take other content down.  
  
You can have a liberal platform; you can have conservative platforms. And the way this is going to come about is not through government but through the marketplace, citizens making choices, people choosing to invest. This is not about neutrality. It’s never been about the republisher.  
  
In the law that I wrote with Congressman Cox, in its language, we were creating what would be called interactive computer services, which would mean making sure more public voices were heard.  
  
There’s a lot of nonsense out there about what this stuff is all about.

不認同。因爲這些平台已經成長爲一個國際的大眾平台，影響力已經不是一間私人公司。而且成長的時候並沒有任何便向性的政策。當你成爲一個大眾都使用的平台後，再加入偏向性的準則完全不利於Public debate，甚至選擇性地發放資訊就是對社會說謊。  
如果認爲自己是偏向性的，可以！類似MSNBC，CNN你偏民主黨OK，FOX你偏共和黨也OK，但別躲在section 230的保護就可以。

section 230本身的意图就不是neutrality。是因为没有这个以前有一个有审核机制的平台因为出现了色情内容而被判有罪，而一个没有任何审核机制的平台出现色情内容被判无罪。section 230就是为了保护有偏见的平台的。因为如果没有section 230的话，所有的平台为了摆脱liability都会取消自己所有的审核，导致有更多的色情，恐怖，极端的言论出现在论坛上。  
  
另外你真的相信一个government comittee能没有偏见的决定什么叫中立？

如果YouTube一開始就說全世界說我就是舔共，我就是喜歡人民幣，任何批評中國的影片我們一律黃標不給收入，甚者刪除頻道。那YouTube能成爲全球的平台嗎？  
  
我不相信！  
  
請注意YouTube的立意就是「YOU」（你），是以內容創造者爲核心，不是觀衆，不是廣告商，更不是Google本身。現在Google實施的審查內容，令You can't be You。創作者因爲審查不能忠於自己的原創。  
  
我的argument很簡單。無論是YouTube還是Twitter，之所以有今天的規模很大程度上得益於是本身言論的開放及Section 230的保護。而成爲全球規模的大眾平台擠掉競爭對手後，卻實施偏見性的言論審查絕對是違反美國憲法的第一修正案保障言論自由。重點是偏見性的審查完全無益與大眾辯論及公衆獲取信息，這些對於民主社會絕對是傷害。  
  
230條款並不能超越憲法，所以當這些大平台刪除它不喜歡的言論的時候，絕對不能獲得230條款的保護。

section 230就是为了保护平台选择性删除言论的权利。youtube如果失去了它之前的开放的言论氛围的话他的用户也会转移到其他的平台。像现在很多conservative频道不是都开podcast。我本人也关注了很多conservative频道来摆脱推荐制度的bias。这些conservative频道还在youtube上发视频就证明了即使被歧视，他们在youtube上的流量还是很客观的 。我们应该做的是宣传其他更中立的平台，给青少年普及如何客观思考和整合信息的方法，以至于不被平台的bias扭曲了自己的看法，而不是一刀切似的来约束私有公司的运营。

首先是川普的影响力很大，其次是 twitter 认为川普经常乱说话，以及看川普不顺眼，所以才标黄标。要是普通人造谣，造成的影响不大，twitter 应该不会搭理。

川普这个政令是在约束平台么？我看不是，是你平台既然审查言论，那么你就得对平台上的言论负责，而不是你一边审查言论一边表示不对平台上的言论负责。川普就是加速推特言论审查，哪来的约束呢？但是你审查随你，你要审查你就得负责，别TM只使用权力而不承担责任。大科技公司为所欲为，既然你不保护别人的言论自由，凭什么要法律保障你的自由，这个行政令就是把模糊空间排除了，但是反而是在实行这条法律真正价值，而不是被利用。

赵立坚在twitter上说：病毒来自美国，是美军在武汉军运会期间带来的。twitter怎么没有审查？  
  
审查本身不是不可以，例如删除一些黄色暴力的内容，但是**不能有政治立场和倾向性**。一旦有倾向性，哪怕剪掉1%的保守派极端言论，久而久之，舆论导向就会被控制。深红的被黄标、删帖、封号，深蓝的再极端造谣都没人管，于是每一个内容创作者，都会自我审查。原来的极右被封杀，极左变成中左，中左变成中间，中间变成右派，右派变成极右，极右又被封杀。一批一批，循环往复，舆论越来越左，逐渐脱离民意。  
  
**大陆的网络审查也是从反色情、反暴力、反谣言开始的，最后整个中文圈都充满了官方的谣言**。2014年快播被取缔，然后就变本加厉，对微信、知乎、豆瓣、抖音等平台进行大面积清洗、删贴、封号。YouTube、Twitter、Facebook、Google 如果再不约束，很快就变成大陆的宣传机器。去年的NBA事件、南方公园事件、VOA断播事件、YouTube黄标事件，都表明大陆的言论审查已经扩散到了美国。  
  
**很多白左，打着“正义”的旗号，做见不得人的事情**。明州警察虐杀老黑就是一个例子。明州是一个深蓝州，即便在2016年希拉里都赢了1.5%。但是警察系统里很多人，骨子里歧视黑人，类似事件不要太多，只是没被拍到，盖牌了而已。要知道，主流媒体都是左派，如果不是铁证如山，很容易被掩盖掉。警察是政府雇员，在一个深蓝州，几十年左派执政，警察体系左倾是必然的。参与虐杀的有4个警察，说明在左倾的警察队伍中，歧视、虐待黑人是普遍现象。  
  
**民主党表面上大谈民主、自由、平等，暗地里和世界上的专制政府勾兑**。奥巴马时期，叙利亚内战久拖不决，川普几个月就搞定了。其实伊斯兰国受到沙特资助，这个恐怖组织控制油田卖石油，幕后的受益者正是华尔街。为什么2011年有“占领华尔街运动”？因为民众已经忍无可忍，2016年川普当选说明民心变了，宁愿让一个政治素人来执政。2020年拜登必输无疑，如果此后左派还不思变革，妄图通过操纵媒体、控制言论，来影响选民，2024年依旧是共和党执政。  
  
**一个社会不能只有一种声音，垄断必然产生专制和腐败**。当80%的主流媒体被左派控制，91.7%的视频内容来自YouTube，87.4%的搜索来自Google，60%的社交来自Facebook，民众应该警醒。拆分垄断企业已经迫在眉睫了。

是的。大家都选择性遗忘了KKK是民主党人了。  
美国黑人在奥巴马八年处境急剧恶化，实际上就是因为民主党的政策--非法移民的大举入侵使得从事低端行业的黑人被抢了饭碗，制造业外移，城市中心的荒芜化，医疗和社保的高昂代价，一切都是将黑人推入更加悲惨的境遇。美国黑人男性的自杀率在奥巴马八年不断攀升，家庭和社区急速解体。黑人已经愤怒了。
